<p><span class="smcap">From</span> where he sat in the crowded day-coach, Philip
Trask’s outlook was bounded by the backward-wheeling
plain of eastern Colorado on one hand, and on the
other by the scarcely less uninteresting cross-section
of humanity filling the car to its seating capacity.
Much earlier in the day he had exhausted the possibilities
of the view from the car window. Shack-built
prairie towns, steadily lessening in size and importance
with the westward flight, had later given place to widely
separated sod houses, the outworks of a slowly advancing
army of pioneer homesteaders. Now even these
had been left behind and there was nothing but the
treeless, limitless plain, with only an occasional prairie-dog
town or, more rarely, a flying herd of antelope,
their fawn-colored bodies fading to invisibility in the
fallow-dun distances, to break the monotony.</p>

<p>New England born and bred, provincial, and just
now with a touch of belated homesickness acute enough
to make him contrast all things primitive with the particular
sort of civilization he had left behind, Philip
owned to no kindling enthusiasm for the region which
the school books were still teaching children to call the
Great American Desert. A student by choice, with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
unfinished college course for his keenest regret, he had
left New Hampshire six months earlier on a plain quest
of bread. Though the migrating moment was late in
the year 1879, the aftermath of the panic of ’73 still
lingered in the East; and while there was work to be
had for immigrant brawn, there was little enough for
native brain.</p>

<p>At this crisis, an uncle of one of his college classmates,
a large shareholder in Kansas Pacific railway
stocks, had come to the rescue by securing a clerkship
for him in the company’s general offices in Kansas
City. Here, after an uneventful half-year spent at an
auditing desk—a period which had left his New England
prejudices and prepossessions practically untouched—consolidation,
the pursuing fate of the
railroad clerk in the ’70’s and ’80’s, overtook him. But
in the labor-saving shake-up he had drawn a lucky
number. Being by this time a fairly efficient juggler
of figures, he was offered a choice of going to Omaha
with the consolidated offices, or of taking a clerkship
with another and newer railroad in Denver.</p>

<p>For no very robust reason, but rather for a very
slender one, Denver had won the toss. Four years
previous to the enforced breaking of Philip’s college
course the elder Trask had disappeared from New
Hampshire under a cloud. A defalcation in the Concord
bank, in which he was one of the tellers, was
threatening to involve him, and between two days John
Trask had vanished, leaving no trace. Alone in the
family connection, which was large, the son had stubbornly
continued to believe in his father’s innocence;
and since the West was ever the port of missing men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
it was in a vague hope of coming upon some trace of
the missing man that Philip had refused the Omaha
alternative and turned his face toward the farther
West.</p>

<p>It was not until he had tried unavailingly to obtain
sleeping-car accommodations, at the outsetting from
the Missouri city, that he was made to realize that Colorado
had suddenly become a Mecca of some sort toward
which a horde of ardent pilgrims was hastening.
True, there had been perfervid accounts in the Kansas
City newspapers of a great silver discovery at a place
called Leadville, somewhere in the Colorado mountains;
but in his leisure, which was scanty, Philip—or,
for that matter, the Trasks as a family—read books
rather than newspapers. Hence the scene at the Kansas
City Union Depot, when he went to take his departure,
was a revelation. Trains over the various lines
from the East were arriving, and excited mobs were
pouring out of them to scramble wildly for seats in
the waiting Overland which, in less time than it took
him to grasp the situation, was in process of being
jammed to overflowing.</p>

<p>Fighting with the mob as best he could—and with
every immiscible fibre of him protesting that it was a
most barbarous thing to do—he finally secured a seat
in one of the day-coaches; and here, save for the three
intervening stops at the meal stations, he had been
wedged in, powerless to do anything but to endure the
banalities and discomforts, wholly out of sympathy
with the riant, free-and-easy treasure-seekers crowding
the car and the train, and anxious only to reach his destination
and be quit of the alien contacts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>The contacts, as he had marked at the outsetting,
were chiefly masculine. Though his coach was the one
next to the sleeping-cars, there were not more than a
dozen women and children in it; and the men, for the
greater part, were, in New England phrase, an outlandish
company. His seatmate, to whom he gave all
the room possible, was a roughly dressed man of uncertain
age, bearded to the eyes and smelling strongly
of liquor. Philip forgave him much because he slept
most of the time, and in his waking intervals did not
try to make conversation. Across the aisle a poker
game with matches for chips was in progress, and a
few seats forward there was another. Now and again
pocket bottles were passed from hand to hand, and
men drank openly with the bald freedom of those who
are far from home and its restraints and so are at
liberty to flout the nicer proprieties.</p>

<p>Philip pitied the few women who were forced by
the travel exigencies into such rude companionship;
particularly he was sorry for a family three seats ahead
on his own side of the car. There were five of them
in all; a father, mother and three girls; and Philip
assured himself that they had nothing remotely in
common with the boisterous majority. In the scramble
for seats at the Kansas City terminal the family
had been divided; the father and mother and the two
younger girls occupying two seats facing each other,
and the older girl—Philip thought she would be about
his own age—sharing the seat next in the rear with
an elderly man, a Catholic priest by the cut of his
clothes and the shape of his hat.</p>

<p>Before the long day’s run was many hours old,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Philip had accounted for the family to his own satisfaction.
The fame of Colorado as a health resort
had already penetrated to the East, and the colorless
face and sunken eyes of the father only too plainly
advertised his malady. Philip knew the marks of the
white plague when he saw them; they were all too
common in his own homeland; and he found himself
wondering sympathetically if the flight to the high and
dry altitudes had not been determined upon too late
to help the hollow-eyed man in the seat ahead.</p>

<p>It was not until the middle of the afternoon that
Philip’s attention was drawn more pointedly to the
family three seats removed. In the day-long journeying
there had been no shifting of places among its
members; but at the last water-tank station passed,
the priest, who had been studiously reading his breviary
for the better part of the day, had left the train, and
the place beside the oldest girl had been taken by a
man whose evil face immediately awakened a curious
thrill of antagonism in Philip.</p>

<p>In a little time he saw that this man was trying to
make the girl talk; also, that she was seeking, ineffectually,
to ignore him. Philip had had little to do
with women other than those of his own family, and
he hailed from a civilization in which the primitive
passions were decently held in leash by the conventions.
Yet he could feel his pulses quickening and a most
unaccustomed prompting to violence taking possession
of him when he realized that a call for some manly
intervention was urging itself upon him.</p>

<p>In a fit of perturbation that was almost boyish, and
with a prescriptive experience that offered no precedent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
he was still hesitating when he saw the girl lean forward
and speak to her father. The sick man twisted
himself in his seat and there was a low-toned colloquy
between him and the offender. Philip could not hear
what was said, but he could easily imagine that the
father was protesting, and that the offender was probably
adding insult to injury, noting, as a coward would,
that he had nothing to fear from a sick man. In the
midst of things the invalid made as if he would rise
to exchange seats with his daughter, but the girl, with
a hand on his shoulder, made him sit down again.</p>

<p>After this, nothing happened for a few minutes.
Then Philip saw the man slide an arm along the seat
behind the girl’s shoulders so that she could not lean
back without yielding to a half embrace, and again his
blood boiled and his temples began to throb. Clearly,
something ought to be done ... if he only knew how
to go about it. He was half rising when he saw the
crowning insult offered. The man had drawn a flat
bottle, whiskey-filled, from his pocket and was offering
it to the girl.</p>

<p>Quite beside himself now, Philip struggled to his
feet; but another was before him. Across the aisle
one of the poker players, a bearded giant in a flannel
shirt and with his belted trousers tucked into his boot-tops,
faced his cards down upon the board that served
as a gaming table and rose up with a roar that brought
an instant craning of necks all over the car.</p>

<p>“Say! I been keepin’ cases on yuh, yuh dern’ son
of a sea cook!” he bellowed, laying a pair of ham-like
hands upon the man in the opposite seat and jerking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
him to his feet in the aisle. Then: “Oh—yuh
would, would yuh!”</p>

<p>Philip, half-dazed by this sudden ebullition of violence,
caught his breath in a gasp when he saw the
flash of a bowie-knife in the hand of the smaller man.
There was a momentary struggle in which the knife
was sent flying through an open window, harsh oaths
from the onlookers, cries of “Pitch him out after his
toad-sticker!” and then a Gargantuan burst of laughter
as the giant pinned both hands of his antagonist in
one of his own and cuffed him into whimpering subjection
with the other. The next thing Philip knew,
the big man, still with his captive hand-manacled and
helpless, was singling him out and bawling at him.</p>

<p>“Here, you young feller; climb out o’ that and make
room fer this yere skunk! Yuh look like <i>you</i> might
sit alongside of a perfect lady without makin’ a dern’
hyena o’ yerself. Step it!”</p>

<p>More to forestall further horrors of embarrassment
than for any other reason, Philip stumbled out over
the knees of his sleeping partner and slipped into the
indicated seat beside the girl. Whereupon the giant
shoved his subdued quarry into the place thus made
vacant and went back to his seat to take up his hand
of cards quite as if the late encounter were a mere
incident in the day’s faring.</p>

<p>Scarcely less embarrassed by having been singled
out as a model of decency than he had been by his
inability to think quickly enough in the crisis, Philip
sat in bottled-up silence for the space of the clicking
of many rail-lengths under the drumming wheels,
carefully refraining from venturing even a sidelong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
glance at his new seatmate. Not that the glance was
needful. The day was no longer young, and he had
had ample time in which to visualize the piquantly
attractive face of the girl beside him. Its perfect oval
was of a type with which he was not familiar, and at
first he had thought it must be foreign. But there
was no suggestion of the alien in the other members
of the family. In sharp contrast to the clear olive skin
and jet-black hair and eyes of the eldest sister, the two
younger girls were fair, and so was the mother. As
for the father, there was little save the cut of his beard
to distinguish him. In a period when the few were
clean shaven and the many let the beard grow as it
would, the invalid reminded Philip of the pictures he
had seen of the third Napoleon, though, to be sure,
the likeness was chiefly in the heavy graying mustaches
and goatee.</p>

<p>Philip thought it must have been somewhere about
the hundredth rail-click that he heard a low voice
beside him say, in a soft drawl that was as far as possible
removed from the clipped speech of his homeland:
“Ought I to say, ‘Thank you, kindly, sir’?”</p>

<p>Philip put his foot resolutely through the crust
of New England reserve, as one breaks the ice of set
purpose.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m the one to be thankful,” he returned,
“since I’ve been sitting all day with a drunken man.
But you’d better not make me talk. I don’t want to
be dragged out by the collar and have my ears boxed.”</p>

<p>His reply brought the smile that he hoped it would,
and he thought he had never seen a set of prettier,
whiter, evener teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“Oh, I don’t reckon the big gentleman would hurt
you.”</p>

<p>“Gentleman?” said Philip.</p>

<p>“Yes; don’t you think he earned the name?”</p>

<p>Philip nodded slowly. But he qualified his assent.
“He might have done it a little more quietly, don’t
you think?”</p>

<p>This time the smile grew into a silvery laugh.</p>

<p>“You mean he made you too conspicuous?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Philip; “I wasn’t thinking of myself.”
Then: “You are from the South?”</p>

<p>“We are from Mississippi, yes. But how could you
tell?”</p>

<p>“You said, ‘I don’t reckon.’”</p>

<p>“Where you would have said—?”</p>

<p>Philip permitted himself a grim little smile. “Where
my grandfather might have said, ‘I don’t calculate.’”</p>

<p>“Oh; then you are a Yankee?”</p>

<p>“I suppose that is what I should be called—in Mississippi.
My home is in New Hampshire.”</p>

<p>“I softened it some,” said the girl half mockingly.
“When I was small, I used to hear it always as ‘damn’
Yankee,’ and for the longest time I supposed it was
just one word. You don’t mind, do you?”</p>

<p>“Why should I mind? The war has been over for
quite a long time.”</p>

<p>“Not so very long; and it will be still longer before
it is over for us of the South. We were whipped, you
know.” Then, turning to the car window: “Oh, look!
See the deer!”</p>

<p>“Antelope,” Philip corrected gravely. “They told
me in Kansas City that only a few years ago the buffalo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
were so thick out here that sometimes the trains
had to be stopped to let the herd go by.”</p>

<p>“You never saw them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I’m new—like everything else out here.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you are going to this place called Leadville
to make your fortune digging gold?—or is it
silver? I never can remember.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he hastened to assure her. “I expect
to go to work in a railroad office in Denver.”</p>

<p>“We are going to Denver, too,” she volunteered.
“The Captain isn’t well, and we are hoping the climate
will help him.”</p>

<p>“The Captain?” Philip queried.</p>

<p>“My father,” she explained. Then, as if upon a
sudden impulse: “Would you care to—may I?”</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” said Philip, adding: “My name
is Trask.”</p>

<p>The easy, self-contained manner in which she compassed
the introductions made him wonder if such gifts
came naturally to young women of the South. He
shook hands rather awkwardly over the back of the
seat with Captain Dabney; tried to say the appropriate
formality to the wife and mother; tried to make big-brotherly
nods to the two younger girls who were
named for him as Mysie and Mary Louise.</p>

<p>“Now then, since you know us all around, we can
talk as much as we want to,” said the girl at his side.</p>

<p>“Not quite all around,” he ventured to point out.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t count; but I’m Jean—not the French
way; just J-e-a-n.”</p>

<p>Philip smiled. “In that case, then, I’m Philip,” he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>The eyes, that were so dark that in certain lights
they seemed to be all pupil, grew thoughtful.</p>

<p>“I’ve always liked that name for a boy,” she asserted
frankly. “And it fits you beautifully. Of
course, you wouldn’t go and dig gold in the mountains.”</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t I?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh, just because the Philips don’t do such things.”
And before he could think of the proper retort: “Why
is everybody looking out of the windows on the other
side of the car?”</p>

<p>“I’ll see,” he replied, and went to investigate. And
when he returned: “We have come in sight of the
mountains. Would you like to see them?”</p>

<p>“I’d love to!” was the eager response, and she got
up and joined him in the aisle. But with more than
half of the car’s complement crowding to the windows
on the sight-seeing side there was no room for another
pair of heads.</p>

<p>“Shall we go out to the platform?” he suggested,
and at her nod he led the way to the swaying, racketing
outdoor vantage where the car-wheel clamor made
anything less than a shout inaudible, and the cinders
showered them, and they had to cling to the hand-railings
to keep from being flung into space.</p>

<p>But for any one with an eye for the grandeurs
there was ample reward. Far away to the southwestward
a great mountain, snow-white against the vivid
blue, was lifting itself in dazzling majesty above the
horizon, and on the hither side it was flanked by
lesser elevations, purple or blue-black in their foresting
of pine and fir. For so long as the whirling shower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
of cinders from the locomotive could be endured they
clung and looked, and the girl would have stayed even
longer if Philip, in his capacity of caretaker, had not
drawn her back into the car and shut the door against
the stinging downpour.</p>

<p>“It would only be a matter of a few minutes until
you’d get your eyes full out there,” he said, in response
to her protest. “Pike’s Peak won’t run away, you
know; and they tell me you can see it any day and
all day from Denver.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what it means to flat-country people,
as we are—our plantation, when we had one, was
in the Yazoo delta. I thought I saw mountains as we
came through Missouri day before yesterday, but they
were nothing but little hills compared with that glorious
thing out there. Isn’t it the finest sight you
ever saw?”</p>

<p>Philip waited until they were back in their seat before
he said: “Pretty fine—yes,” which was as far
as his blood and breeding would let him agree with
the superlatives.</p>

<p>A mocking little laugh greeted this guarded reply.</p>

<p>“Is that the best you can do for one of nature’s
masterpieces?” she asked. Then, with more of the
appalling frankness: “I wonder if your sort ever
wakes up and lets itself go? I can hardly imagine it.”</p>

<p>“I guess I don’t know just what you mean,” said
Philip; but he was smarting as if the wondering query
had been the flick of a whip.</p>

<p>“No; you wouldn’t,” was the flippant retort.
“Never mind. How much farther is it to Denver?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>Philip consulted the railroad folder with which he
had supplied himself.</p>

<p>“We ought to be there in another hour. I suppose
you’ll be glad. It’s a long journey from Mississippi.”</p>

<p>“We’ll all be glad—for the Captain’s sake. It has
been hard for him.”</p>

<p>“Your father was a soldier in the war?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” she nodded. “He is a Mississippian.”</p>

<p>“Was he—was he wounded?” Philip ventured.</p>

<p>“Not with bullets. But he spent a year in a Northern
prison.”</p>

<p>Philip, abashed by the implication conveyed in this,
relapsed into silence. Libby Prison and Andersonville
were still frightful realities in the New England mind,
and the remembrance of them extinguished the fact
that there had been war prisons in the North, as well.</p>

<p>“War is a pretty dreadful thing,” he conceded;
adding: “My father was wounded at Antietam.”</p>

<p>“Let’s not begin to talk about the war; we’ll be
quarrelling in another minute or two if we do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t admit that,” Philip contended amicably.
“As I said a little while ago, the war is over—it’s been
over for fifteen years. But let it go and tell me about
Mississippi. I’ve never been farther south than we
are just now.”</p>

<p>“Dear old Mississippi!” she said softly. And after
that the talk became a gentle monologue for the greater
part, in which Philip heard the story duplicated so
often south of Mason and Dixon’s line; of the hardships
of the war, and the greater hardships of its aftermath;
of ill health and property loss; of hope deferred
and almost extinguished in the case of the invalid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
father; of the final family council in which it had
been determined to try the healing effect of the high
and dry altitudes.</p>

<p>Philip listened and was moved, not only by sympathy,
which—again in strict accordance with his blood
and breeding—he was careful not to express, but also
by a vast wonder. No young woman of his limited
acquaintance in the homeland could ever have been
induced to talk so frankly and freely to a comparative
stranger. Yet there was also a proud reserve just
behind the frankness, and after a time he came to
understand that it was pride of birth. The Dabneys,
as he gathered, were an ancient family, descended from
the Huguenot D’Aubignys, and originally Virginians.
As a Trask and a son of more or less hardy New England
stock, family traditions meant little to him. But
he was beginning to see that they meant very much
indeed to the soft-speaking young woman beside him.</p>

<p>“It is evident that you believe in blue blood,” he
ventured to say, after the Dabney lineage had been
fairly traced for him. Then he added: “We don’t
think so very much of that in New England.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t see how you can help it,” was the
astonished exclamation. “Don’t you believe in heredity?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose I do, in a way,” he qualified. “We
can’t expect to gather figs from thistles. Still, it is
a long step from that admission to a belief in—well,
in anything like an aristocracy of the blood.”</p>

<p>“You think there is no such thing as gentle blood?”</p>

<p>“Not in the sense that one person is intrinsically
better than another. Unless all history is at fault,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
the ‘gentle blood’ you speak of is just as likely to go
hideously wrong as any other.”</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you at all,” was the prompt
retort.</p>

<p>“I didn’t expect you would—after what you have
been telling me. But we needn’t quarrel about it,” he
went on good-naturedly. “I suppose you would call
your family patrician and mine plebeian—which it
doubtless is; at any rate, it is farmer stock on both
sides as far back as I know anything about it, people
who worked with their hands, and——”</p>

<p>“It was no disgrace for them to work with their
hands; that isn’t at all what I meant. It is something
much bigger than that.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it, then? A clean family record?”</p>

<p>“Honor above everything: not being willing—not
being able to stoop to anything low or mean or——”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Philip. “I guess we’re not so very
far apart, after all; though I doubt if I could tell you
the Christian name of any one of my four great-grandfathers—to
say nothing of the great-grandmothers.
But look out of the window! Houses, if my
eyes don’t deceive me. This must be Denver that we’re
coming to.”</p>

<p>Rounding a curve so long and gentle as to make
the changing direction approximate the slow inching
of a clock’s minute-hand, the train was beginning to
pass signs of human occupancy, or of former occupancy;
on the right a collection of empty, tumble-down
shacks and the ruin of what seemed to be a smelting
works. A little farther along, the fringe of the inhabited
town was passed, and the clanking of switch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
frogs under the wheels signalled the approach to the
freight yards. Over a swelling hill to the northward
the mountains came into view in peaks and masses
against which the plain seemed to end with startling
abruptness.</p>

<p>When the brakes began to grind, Philip excused
himself and went to get his hand luggage out of the
rack over the seat he had formerly occupied.</p>

<p>“If I can be of any assistance?” he offered when
he came back.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think we can manage, thank you; there are
so many of us to carry things,” the young woman replied.
“Besides, we’ll have to take a carriage—on the
Captain’s account.”</p>

<p>With his attention thus drawn again to the invalid,
Philip had a sharp recurrence of the doubt as to
whether the change of climate had been determined
upon soon enough to warrant any hope of recovery
for the hollow-eyed man in the seat ahead. For the
past half-hour the sick man had been coughing unobtrusively,
and he seemed to have increasing difficulty
in breathing. Since Kansas City was the gateway for
westbound invalids, as well as for the mineral-mad
treasure-seekers, Philip had heard stories of the marvelous
cures effected by the Colorado climate; also he
had heard that those who went too late were apt to
die very quickly, the swift railroad flight from an
altitude of a few hundred feet to that of a mile high
proving too sudden a change for the weakened lungs.</p>

<p>Acting wholly upon an impulse which he did not
stop to define, or to square with the New England
reticences, Philip bent to speak to the card-playing giant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
who had freed the young woman of her persecutor.</p>

<p>“Have you much hand baggage to take care of?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ on top of earth but my gun and my blankets.
Why?”</p>

<p>“If you wouldn’t mind taking my satchel and dropping
it off outside?” Philip went on, “I want to help
the sick man.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, cully,” returned the giant heartily.
“Reckon yuh can handle him alone? Because if yuh
can’t, we’ll chuck the plunder out o’ the window and
both of us’ll tackle him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think I can do it all right. Maybe he won’t
need any help, but I thought he might.”</p>

<p>“Look’s if he’d need all he can get; ’s if it wouldn’t
take much of a breeze to blow him away. Shouldn’t
wonder if he’d put it off too long—this yere trailin’
out to the tall hills. Well, this is the dee-po: leave
me yer grip and jump in.”</p>

<p>Philip turned quickly to the group in the double
seat and again offered his help in the matter of debarking.
This time it was accepted gratefully. Picking
up one of the Dabney valises, he gave an arm to
the sick man. The progress through the crowded
aisle to the car platform was irritatingly slow and
fatiguing, and before the door was reached the invalid
was seized with another coughing fit. Through
the open car door the thin, keen wind of the April
evening blew in the faces of the outgoing passengers,
and even Philip, who was as fit and vigorous as an
indoor man ever gets to be, found himself breathing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
deeply to take in enough of the curiously attenuated
air to supply his need.</p>

<p>In due time the descent of the car steps was accomplished,
but the exhausting coughing fit persisted, and
Philip felt the invalid leaning more and more heavily
upon him. It was some little distance from the tracks
over to the line of waiting busses and hacks, and before
it was covered the oldest daughter gave her hand
luggage to one of her sisters and came back to help
Philip with his charge. Philip was prodigiously thankful.
The painful cough had become almost a paroxysm,
and he was shocked to see that the handkerchief the
sick man was holding to his mouth was flecked with
bright red spots.</p>

<p>“Just a little way farther, now, Captain, dearest!”
Philip heard the low-toned words of encouragement,
and was overwhelmed with an unnerving fear that the
man would die before he could be taken to wherever
it was that the family was going. But with the fear,
and presently overriding it, was a kindling admiration
for the daughter. She knew what the red-flecked
handkerchief meant, but she was not letting the frightful
possibility submerge her.</p>

<p>The hack rank was reached at last, and with the
driver of the chosen vehicle to help, the sick man was
lifted into his place. While the mother and the younger
daughters were getting in, Philip spoke to his late
seat-sharer.</p>

<p>“Have you friends in Denver?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No; we shall go to a hotel for the present—to the
American House.”</p>

<p>“Shall I go with you and try to find a doctor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“There will probably be a doctor in the hotel; anyway,
we’ve no right to trouble you any further. But
I—we don’t forget. And I’m sorry I said things about
Yankees and the Philips, and about—about your waking
up. It was mean and unfriendly, and I’m sorry.
Good-by—and thank you so much for helping us.
And please try not to remember the meannesses.
Good-by.”</p>

<p>Philip watched the laden hack as it was driven away
and wondered if he would ever see the black-eyed little
Mississippian with the heroic nerves again. He
was still wondering when the good-natured giant came
along and gave him his valise.</p>

<p>“Got the little gal and her hull kit and caboodle on
their way, did yuh?” said the big one, with a fierce
grin which was meant to be altogether friendly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Philip. Then he picked up his valise and
trudged off in search of a horse-car that would take
him to his own temporary destination, a modest hotel
on the west side of the town, to which a travelled fellow
clerk in the Kansas City railroad office had directed
him.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bright</span> and early on the morning following his arrival
in Denver, Philip presented himself at the general
offices of the narrow-gauge mountain railroad to the
officials of which he had been recommended by his late
employers in Kansas City, and was promptly given a
desk in the accounting department; the department
head, whose thin, sandy hair, straggling gray beard
and protuberant eyes gave him the aspect of a weird
but benevolent pre-Adamite bird, asking but a single
question.</p>

<p>“Not thinking of going prospecting right away, are
you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Philip, wondering what there might be
in his appearance to suggest any such thing.</p>

<p>“All right; the bookkeeper will show you where to
hang your coat.”</p>

<p>The employment footing made good, the newcomer’s
spare time for the first few days was spent
looking for a boarding place, the West Denver hotel,
regarded from the thrifty New England point of view,
proving far too expensive. The after-hours’ search
gave him his earliest impressions of a city at the moment
figuring as a Mecca, not only for eager fortune
seekers of all ranks and castes, but also for mining-rush
camp followers of every description. With the
railroads daily pouring new throngs into the city, housing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
was at a fantastic premium, and many of the open
squares were covered with the tents of those for whom
there was no shelter otherwise. Having certain well-defined
notions of what a self-respecting bachelor’s
quarters should be, Philip searched in vain, and was
finally constrained to accept the invitation of a fellow
clerk in the railroad office to take him as a room-mate—this
though the acceptance involved a rather rude shattering
of the traditions. Instead of figuring as a
paying guest in a home-like private house—no small
children—with at least two of the daily meals at the
family table, he found himself sharing dingy sleeping
quarters on the third floor of a down-town business
block, with the option of eating as he could in the turmoil
of the dairy lunches and restaurants or going
hungry.</p>

<p>“No home-sheltered coddling for you in this live
man’s burg. The quicker you get over your tenderfoot
flinchings, the happier you’ll be,” advised Middleton,
with whom the down-town refuge was shared, and
who, by virtue of a six-weeks’ longer Western residence
than Philip’s, postured, in his own estimation at least,
as an “old-timer.” “‘When you’re in Rome’—you
know the rest of it. And let me tell you: you’ll have
to chase your feet to keep up with the procession here,
Philly, my boy. These particular Romans are a pretty
swift lot, if you’ll let me tell it.”</p>

<p>Philip winced a little at the familiar “Philly.” He
had known Middleton less than a week and was still
calling him “Mister.” But familiarity of the nick-naming
and back-slapping variety seemed to be the
order of the day; a boisterous, hail-fellow-well-met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
freedom breezily brushing aside the conventional preliminaries
to acquaintanceship. It was universal and
one had to tolerate it; but Philip told himself that
toleration need not go the length of imitation or
approval.</p>

<p>Work, often stretching into many hours of overtime,
filled the first few weeks for the tenderfoot from New
Hampshire. The narrow-gauge railroad reaching out
toward Leadville was taxed to its capacity and beyond,
and there was little rest and less leisure for the office
force. Still, Philip was able now and again to catch
an appraisive glimpse of what was now becoming a
thrilling and spectacular scene in the great American
drama of development,—a headling, migratory irruption
which had had its prototypes in the rush of the
’49-ers to the California gold fields, the wagon-train
dash for Pike’s Peak, and the now waning invasion of
the Black Hills by the gold seekers, but which differed
from them all in being facilitated and tremendously
augmented by a swift and easy railroad approach.
Vaguely at first, but later with quickening pulses,
Philip came to realize that the moment was epochal;
that he was a passive participant in a spectacle which
was marking one of the mighty human surges by which
the wilderness barriers are broken down and the waste
places occupied.</p>

<p>With a prophetic premonition that this might well
be the last and perhaps the greatest of the surges,
Philip was conscious of a growing and militant desire
to be not only in it, but of it. The very air he
breathed was intoxicating with the spirit of avid and
eager activity and excitement, and the rush to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
mountains increased as the season advanced. The
labor turn-over in the railroad office grew to be a
hampering burden, and now Philip understood why
the auditor had asked him if he were a potential
treasure hunter. Almost every day saw a new clerk
installed to take the place of a fresh deserter. After
the lapse of a short month, Philip, Middleton and
Baxter, the head bookkeeper, were the three oldest
employees, in point of time served, in the auditing department.
Two railroads, the South Park and the
Denver &amp; Rio Grande, were building at frantic speed
toward Leadville, racing each other to be first at the
goal; and from the daily advancing end-of-track of
each a stage line hurried the mixed mob of treasure-seekers
and birds of prey of both sexes on to their
destination in the great carbonate camp at the head
of California Gulch. To sit calmly at a desk adding
columns of figures while all this was going on became
at first onerous, and later a daily fight for the needful
concentration upon the adding monotonies.</p>

<p>By this time some of the first fruits of the carbonate
harvest reaped and reaping in the sunset shadow of
Mount Massive were beginning to make themselves
manifest in the return to Denver of sundry lucky
Argonauts whose royal spendings urged the plangencies
to a quickened and more sonorous wave-beat. One
victorious grub-staker was said to be burdened with
an income of a quarter of a million a month from a
single mine, and was sorely perplexed to find ways in
which to spend it. A number of fortunate ones were
buying up city lots at unheard-of prices; one was
building a palatial hotel; another was planning a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
theater which was to rival the Opéra in Paris in costly
magnificence.</p>

<p>These were substantials, and there were jocose extravagances
to chorus them. One heard of a pair of
cuff-links, diamond and emerald studded, purchased
to order at the price of a king’s ransom; of a sybaritic
Fortunatus who reveled luxuriously in night-shirts at
three thousand dollars a dozen; of men who scorned
the humble “chip” in the crowded gaming rooms and
played with twenty-dollar gold pieces for counters.</p>

<p>Philip saw and heard and was conscious of penetrating
inward stirrings. Was the totting-up of
figures all he was good for? True, there were money-making
opportunities even at the railroad desk; chances
to lend his thrifty savings at usurious interest to
potential prospectors; chances to make quick turn-overs
on small margins, and with certain profits, in real-estate;
invitations to get in on “ground floors” in many
promising enterprises, not excepting the carefully
guarded inside stock pool of the railroad company he
was working for. But the inward stirrings were not
for these ventures in the commonplace; they were even
scornful of them. Money-lending, trading, stockjobbing—these
were for the timid. For the venturer
unafraid there was a braver and a richer field.</p>

<p>“How much experience does a fellow have to have
to go prospecting?” he asked of Middleton, one day
when the figure-adding had grown to be an anæsthetizing
monotony hard to be borne.</p>

<p>Middleton grinned mockingly. “Hello!” he said.
“It’s got you at last, has it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“I asked a plain question. What’s the answer?—if
you know it.”</p>

<p>“Experience? Nine-tenths of the fools who are
chasing into the hills don’t know free gold from iron
pyrites, or carbonates from any other kind of black
sand. It’s mostly bull luck when they find anything.”</p>

<p>“Yet they <i>are</i> finding it,” Philip put in.</p>

<p>“You hear of those who find it. The Lord knows,
they make racket enough spending the proceeds. But
you never hear much about the ninety-nine in a hundred
who don’t find it.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, according to your tell, one man’s
chance seems to be about as good as another’s. I believe
I’d like to have a try at it, Middleton. Want to
go along?”</p>

<p>“Not in a thousand years!” was the laughing refusal.
“I’ll take mine straight, and in the peopled
cities. I’ve got a girl back in Ohio, and I’m going
after her one of these days—after this wild town
settles down and quits being so rude and boisterous.”</p>

<p>Philip looked his desk-mate accusingly in the eye.</p>

<p>“It’s an even bet that you don’t,” he said calmly.</p>

<p>“Why won’t I?”</p>

<p>“I saw you last night-down at the corner of
Holladay and Seventeenth.”</p>

<p>Middleton, lately a country-town bank clerk in his
native Ohio, but who was now beginning to answer
the invitation of a pair of rather moist eyes and lips
that were a trifle too full, tried to laugh it off.</p>

<p>“You mean the ‘chippy’ I was with? I’m no monk,
Philly; never set up to be. Besides, I’m willing to
admit that I may have had one too many whiskey sours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
last night. Cheese it, and tell me what’s on your mind.”</p>

<p>“I’ve already told you. I think I’ll try my luck in
the hills, if I can find a partner.”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” grunted Middleton, turning back to his
tonnage sheet. “As for the partner part, all you have
to do is to chase down to the station and shoot your
invitation at the first likely looking fellow who gets
off the next incoming train. He’ll be a rank tenderfoot,
of course, but that won’t make any difference:
there’ll be a pair of you—both innocents. Why, say,
Philly; I’ll bet you’ve still got your first drink of red
liquor waiting for you! Come, now—own up;
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“I should hope so,” said Philip austerely. “I
didn’t come all the way out here to make a fool of
myself.”</p>

<p>This time Middleton’s grin was openly derisive.</p>

<p>“My, my!” he jeered. “The spirit moves me to
prophesy. I know your kind, Philly—up one side and
down the other. When you let go, I hope I’ll be there
to see. It’ll be better than a three-ring circus. Wine,
women and song, and all the rest of it. Speaking of
women——”</p>

<p>“You needn’t,” Philip cut in shortly; and he got up
to answer the auditor’s desk bell.</p>

<p>The process of securing a partner for a prospecting
trip was scarcely the simple matter that Middleton’s
gibing suggestion had made it. Though there were
many haphazard matings achieved hastily at the outfitting
moment, a goodly proportion of the treasure
hunters were coming in pairs and trios hailing from a
common starting point in the east. In spite of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
free-and-easy levelling of the conventions, Philip found
it difficult to make acquaintances, his shell of provincial
reserve remaining unchipped, though he tried hard
enough to break it. Besides, he felt that he was justified
in trying to choose judiciously. He could conceive
of no experience more devastating than to be
isolated in the wilderness for weeks and perhaps
months with an ill-chosen partner for his only companion.
The very intimacy of such an association
would make it unbearable.</p>

<p>It was while he was still hesitating that a small duty
urged itself upon him. It concerned the Mississippi
family with the death-threatened husband and father.
In a city where all were strangers he had fully intended
keeping in touch with the Dabneys, if only to
be ready to offer what small help a passing acquaintance
might in case the threatened catastrophe should
climax. Since he would shortly be leaving Denver,
the duty pressed again, and he set apart an evening
for the tracing of the Mississippians, going first to
the American House to make inquiries.</p>

<p>Fortunately for his purpose, one of the hotel clerks,
himself a Southerner, remembered the Dabneys. They
had remained but a few days in the hotel; were now,
so the clerk believed, camping in one of the tent colonies
out on California or Stout Streets somewhere between
Twentieth and Twenty-third. Yes, Captain Dabney
had been in pretty bad shape, but it was to be assumed
that he was still living. The clerk had been sufficiently
interested to keep track of the obituary notices in the
newspapers, and the Dabney name had not appeared in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
any of them. Inquiry among the tenters would probably
enable Philip to find them.</p>

<p>Reproaching himself for his prolonged negligence,
Philip set out to extend his search to the tent colonies.
It was after he had reached the more sparsely built-up
district, and was crossing a vacant square beyond the
better-lighted streets, that a slender figure, seemingly
materializing out of the ground at his feet, rose up to
confront him, a pistol was thrust into his face, and he
heard the familiar formula: “Hands up—and be quick
about it!”</p>

<p>It is probably a fact that the element of shocked
surprise, no less than the natural instinct of self-preservation,
accounts for the easy success of the
majority of hold-ups. Sudden impulse automatically
prompts obedience, and the chance of making any
resistance is lost. But impulsiveness was an inconsequent
part of Philip’s equipment. Quite coolly measuring
his chances, and well assured that he had a considerable
advantage in avoirdupois, he knocked the
threatening weapon aside and closed in a quick grapple
with the highwayman. He was not greatly surprised
when he found that his antagonist, though slightly
built, was as wiry and supple as a trained acrobat;
but in the clinching struggle it was weight that
counted, and when the brief wrestling match ended in
a fall, the hold-up man was disarmed and spread-eagled
on the ground and Philip was sitting on him.</p>

<p>When he could get his breath the vanquished one
laughed.</p>

<p>“Made a complete, beautiful and finished fizzle of it,
d-didn’t I?” he gasped. “Let me tell you, my friend,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
it isn’t half so easy as it is made to appear in the
yellow-back novels.”</p>

<p>“What the devil do you mean—trying to hold me up
with a gun?” Philip demanded angrily.</p>

<p>“Why—if you must know, I meant to rob you; to
take and appropriate to my own base uses that which
I have not, and which you presumably have. Not
having had the practice which makes perfect, I seem
to have fallen down. Would you mind sitting a little
farther back on me? I could breathe much better if
you would.”</p>

<p>Philip got up and picked up the dropped weapon.</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought to shoot you with your own
gun,” he snapped; and the reply to that was another
chuckling laugh.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t, you know,” said the highwayman,
sitting up. “It’s perfectly harmless—empty, as you
may see for yourself if you’ll break it. You were quite
safe in ignoring it.”</p>

<p>Philip regarded him curiously.</p>

<p>“What kind of a hold-up are you, anyway?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“The rottenest of amateurs, as you have just proved
upon my poor body. I thank you for the demonstration.
It decides a nice question for me. I hesitated
quite some time before I could tip the balance between
this, and going into a restaurant, ordering and consuming
a full meal, and being kicked out ignominiously
for non-payment afterward. This seemed the more
decent thing to do, but it is pretty evident that I lack
something in the way of technique. Wouldn’t you
say so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“I should say that you are either a fool or crazy,”
said Philip bluntly.</p>

<p>“Wrong, both ways from the middle,” was the
jocular retort. “At the present moment I am merely
an empty stomach; and empty stomachs, as you may
have observed, are notoriously lacking in any moral
sense. May I get up?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Philip; and when the man was afoot:
“Now walk ahead of me to that street lamp on the
corner. I want to have a look at you.”</p>

<p>What the street lamp revealed was what he was
rather expecting to see; a handsome, boyish face a
trifle thin and haggard, eyes that were sunken a little,
but with an unextinguished smile in them, a fairly
good chin and jaw, a mouth just now wreathing itself
in an impish grin under his captor’s frowning scrutiny.</p>

<p>“Umph!—you don’t look like a very hard case,”
Philip decided.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I am, I assure you. I’ve been kicked out
of two respectable colleges, dropped from the home
club for conduct unbecoming a gentleman, and finally
turned out of house and home by a justifiably irate
father. Can I say more?”</p>

<p>“What are you doing in Denver?”</p>

<p>“You saw what I was trying to do a few minutes
ago. The outcome dovetails accurately with everything
else I have attempted since I parted with the final dollar
of the even thousand with which I was disinherited.
Failure seems to be my baptismal name.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Henry Wigglesworth Bromley. Please don’t smile
at the middle third of it. That is a family heirloom—worse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
luck. But to the matter in hand: I’m afraid I’m
detaining you. Shall I—‘mog,’ is the proper frontier
word, I believe—shall I mog along down-town and
surrender myself to the police?”</p>

<p>“Would you do that if I should tell you to?”</p>

<p>“Why not, if you require it? You are the victor,
and to the victors belong the spoils—such as they are.
If you hunger for vengeance, you shall have it. Only
I warn you in advance that it won’t be complete. If
the police lock me up, they will probably feed me, so
you won’t be punishing me very savagely.”</p>

<p>For once in a way Philip yielded to an impulse, a
prompting that he was never afterward able to trace
to any satisfactory source. Dropping the captured
revolver into his coat pocket, he pressed a gold piece
into the hand of the amateur hold-up.</p>

<p>“Say that I’ve bought your gun and go get you a
square meal,” he said, trying to say it gruffly. “Afterward,
if you feel like it, go and sit in the lobby of the
American House for your after-dinner smoke. I’m
not making it mandatory. If you’re not there when I
get back, it will be all right.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; while I’m eating I’ll think about that
potential appointment. If I can sufficiently forget the
Wigglesworth in my name I may keep the tryst, but
don’t bank on it. I may—with a full-fed stomach—have
a resurgence of the Wigglesworth family pride,
and in that case——”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said Philip abruptly, and went his
way toward the tent colony in the next open square,
wondering again where the impulse to brother this
impish but curiously engaging highwayman came from.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">III</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> circumstances in which it would have been easy
enough to fail, Philip found the family he was looking
for almost at once; and it was the young woman with
the dark eyes and hair and the enticing Southland voice
and accent who slipped between the flaps of the lighted
tent when he made his presence known.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Trask—is it you?” she exclaimed, as the
dim lamplight filtering through the canvas enabled her
to recognize him. “This is kind of you, I’m sure.
We’ve been wondering if we should ever see you again.
I can’t imagine how you were ever able to find us.”</p>

<p>Philip, rejoicing in the softly smothered “r’s” of
her speech, explained soberly. It was not so difficult.
He had gone first to the hotel; and once in the tented
square, a few inquiries had sufficed.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I can’t ask you in,” she hastened to say.
“You see, there isn’t so awfully much room in a tent,
and—and the children are just going to bed. Would
you mind sitting out here?”</p>

<p>There was a bench on the board platform that served
as a dooryard for the tent, and they sat together on
that. For the first few minutes Philip had an attack
of self-consciousness that made him boil inwardly
with suppressed rage. His human contacts for the
past few weeks—or months, for that matter—had been
strictly masculine, and he had never been wholly at ease<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
with women, save those of his own family. Stilted
inquiries as to how the sick Captain was getting along,
and how they all liked Denver and the West, and how
they thought the climate and the high altitude were
going to agree with them, were as far as he got before
a low laugh, with enough mockery in it to prick him
sharply, interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” she murmured, “but it’s so deliciously
funny to see you make such hard work of it. Are
there no girls in the part of Yankeeland you come
from?”</p>

<p>“Plenty of them,” he admitted; “but they are not
like you.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she laughed. “Is that a compliment, or the
other thing?”</p>

<p>“It is just the plain truth. But the trouble isn’t with
girls—it’s with me. I guess I’m not much of a ladies’
man.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’re not; I can’t imagine anything more
deadly. Are you still working for the railroad?”</p>

<p>“Just at present, yes. But I’ll be quitting in a few
days. I’m going to try my luck in the mountains—prospecting.”</p>

<p>“But—I thought you said you wouldn’t!”</p>

<p>“I did; but I was younger then than I am now.”</p>

<p>She laughed again. “All of six weeks younger. But
I’m glad you are going. If the Captain could get well,
and I were a man, I’d go, too.”</p>

<p>Philip was on the point of saying that he wished she
were a man and would go with him; but upon second
thought he concluded he didn’t wish it. Before he
could straighten out the tangle of the first and second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
thoughts she was asking him if he knew anything
about minerals and mining.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all. But others who don’t know any
more than I do are going, and some of them are finding
what they hoped to find.”</p>

<p>“It’s in the air,” she said. “You hear nothing but
‘strikes’ and ‘leads’ and ‘mother veins’ and ‘bonanzas.’
Lots of the people in these tents around us are here
because some member of the family is sick, but they
all talk excitedly about the big fortunes that are being
made, and how Tom or Dick or Harry has just come
in with a haversack full of ‘the pure quill,’ whatever
that may mean.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t been hearing any more of it than I
have,” said Philip. “Not as much, I think. The town
is mad with the mining fever. I’m only waiting until
I can find a suitable partner.”</p>

<p>“That ought not to be very hard—with everybody
wanting to go.”</p>

<p>Philip shook his head. “I guess I’m not built right
for mixing with people. I can’t seem to chum in with
just anybody that comes along.”</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to,” she returned decisively. Then,
again with the mocking note in her voice: “They say
the prospectors often have to fight to hold their claims
after they have found them: you ought to pick out
some big, strong fighting man for a partner, don’t you
think?”</p>

<p>Philip was glad the canvas-filtered lamplight was
too dim to let her see the flush her words evoked.</p>

<p>“You are thinking of that day on the train, and how
I let the husky miner take your part when I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
have done it myself? I’m not such a coward as that.
I was trying to get out of my seat when the miner man
got ahead of me. I want you to believe that.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll believe it.” Then, quite penitently:
“You must forgive me for being rude again: I simply
can’t help saying the meanest things, sometimes. Still,
you know, I can’t imagine you as a fighter, really.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you?” said Philip; and then he boasted: “I
had a fight with a hold-up on the way out here this
evening—and got the best of him, too.” Whereupon
he described with dry humor Henry Wigglesworth
Bromley’s attempt to raise the price of a square meal;
the brief battle and its outcome.</p>

<p>“You haven’t told all of it,” she suggested, when
he paused with his refusal to accept Bromley’s offer
to arrest himself on a charge of attempted highway
robbery.</p>

<p>“What part have I left out?”</p>

<p>“Just the last of it, I think. You gave the robber
some money to buy the square meal—I’m sure you
did.”</p>

<p>“You are a witch!” Philip laughed. “That is exactly
what I did do. I don’t know why I did it, but
I did.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> know why,” was the prompt reply. “It was because
you couldn’t help it. The poor boy’s desperation
appealed to you—it appeals to me just in your telling
of it. He isn’t bad; he is merely good stock gone to
seed. Couldn’t you see that?”</p>

<p>“Not as clearly as you seem to. But he did appear
to be worth helping a bit.”</p>

<p>“Ah; that is the chord I was trying to touch. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
ought to help him some more, Mr. Trask. Don’t you
reckon so?”</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Trask’ wouldn’t, but perhaps ‘Philip’ would,”
he suggested mildly.</p>

<p>“Well, ‘Philip,’ then. Don’t you see how brave he
is?—to laugh at himself and all his misfortunes, the
hardships his wildness has brought upon him? You
say you are looking for a prospecting partner; why
don’t you take him?”</p>

<p>“Do you really mean that?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I mean it. It might result in two good
things. If you could get him off in the mountains by
himself, and live with him, and make him work hard,
you might make a real man of him.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Philip. “That is one of the two good
things. What is the other?”</p>

<p>“The other is what it might do for you. Or am I
wrong about that?”</p>

<p>“No,” he said, after a little pause. “I still think
you are a witch. You’ve found out that I live in a
shell, and it’s so. I guess I was born that way. You
think the shell would crack if I should take hold of a
man like this Bromley and try to brother him?”</p>

<p>“I am sure it would,” she replied gravely. “It
couldn’t help cracking.” Then, as a low-toned call
came from the inside of the tent: “Yes, mummie,
dear,—I’m coming.”</p>

<p>Philip got up and held out his hand.</p>

<p>“I am sorry I’m going away, because I’d like to be
within call if you should need me. If you should move
into a house, or leave Denver, will you let me know?
A note addressed to me in care of the railroad office<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
will be either forwarded or held until I come back.”</p>

<p>“I’ll write,” she promised, and the quick veiling of
the dark eyes told him that she knew very well what
he meant by her possible need.</p>

<p>“And about this young scapegrace who tried to hold
me up: what you have suggested never occurred to me
until you spoke of it. But if you think I ought to
offer to take him along into the mountains, I don’t
know but I’ll do it. It wouldn’t be any crazier than
the things a lot of other people are doing in this
mining-mad corner of the world just now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t take me too seriously. I have no
right to tell you what you should do. But I did have
a glimpse of what it might mean. I’m going to wish
you good luck—the very best of luck. If you really
want to be rich, I hope you’ll find one of these beautiful
‘bonanzas’ people are talking about; find it and live
happily ever after. Good-by.”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said Philip; and when she disappeared
behind the tent flap, he picked his way out of the
campers’ square and turned his steps townward.</p>

<p>It was after he had walked the five squares westward
on Champa and the six northward down Seventeenth,
and was turning into Blake, with the American House
only a block distant, that a girlish figure slipped out of
a doorway shadow, caught step with him, and slid a
caressing arm under his with a murmured, “You look
lonesome, baby, and I’m lonesome, too. Take me
around to Min’s and stake me to a bottle of wine. I’m
so thirsty I don’t know where I’m going to sleep to-night.”</p>

<p>Philip freed himself with a twist that had in it all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
the fierce virtue of his Puritan ancestry. Being fresh
from a very human contact with a young woman of
another sort, this appeal of the street-girl was like a
stumbling plunge into muddy water. Backing away
from the temptation which, he told himself hotly, was
no temptation at all, he walked on quickly, and had
scarcely recovered his balance when he entered the
lobby of the hotel. Almost immediately he found
Bromley, sprawled in one of the lounging chairs, deep
in the enjoyment of a cigar which he waved airily as
he caught sight of Philip.</p>

<p>“<i>Benedicite</i>, good wrestler! Pull up a chair and rest
your face and hands,” he invited. Then, with a cheerful
smile: “Why the pallid countenance? You look as
though you’d just seen a ghost. Did some other fellow
try to hold you up?”</p>

<p>Philip’s answering smile was a twisted grimace.
“No; it was a woman, this time.”</p>

<p>“Worse and more of it. Lots of little devils in
skirts chivvying around this town. Too many men
fools roaming the streets with money in their pockets.
‘Wheresoever the body is, there will the eagles be
gathered together’—only they’re not exactly eagles;
they are birds of another feather. I know, because
they clawed me a bit before my wallet went dry.”</p>

<p>“You were one of the fools?” said Philip sourly.</p>

<p>“You’d know it without my telling you. But to the
law and the testimony. You see, the Wigglesworth
family pride didn’t prevent me from keeping your
kindly hint in mind—and I’ve obeyed it. Where do
we begin?”</p>

<p>“Suppose we begin where we left off,” said Philip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
guardedly. “Is there any decent ambition left in
you?”</p>

<p>Bromley took time to consider, and when he replied
he was shaking his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“To be perfectly frank about it, I’m not sure there
has ever been anything worthy the high sounding name
of ambition. You see, there is quite a lot of Bromley
property scattered about in my home town—which is
Philadelphia, if you care to know—and the income
from it has heretofore proved fatal to anything like
decent ambition on the part of a play-boy.”</p>

<p>“Your property?” Philip queried.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no; the governor’s. But he hasn’t kept
too tight a hand on the purse strings; not tight enough,
if we are to judge from the effects—the present horrible
example being the most disastrous of the same.
As I intimated on the scene of my latest fiasco, I
stretched the rubber band once too often and it snapped
back at me with a disinheriting thousand-dollar check
attached. That, my dear benefactor, is my poor tale,
poorly told. You see before you what might have been
a man, but what probably—most probably—never will
be a man.”</p>

<p>“Of course, if you are willing to let it go at
that——” said Philip, leaving the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>“You mean that I ought to pitch in and do something
useful? My dear Mr. Good-wrestler——”</p>

<p>“My name is Trask,” Philip cut in shortly.</p>

<p>“Well, then, my dear Trask, I have never learned
how to do useful things. One has to learn, I believe,
if it’s only washing dishes in a cheap restaurant, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
chopping wood. I should inevitably break the dishes,
or let the axe slip and chop my foot.”</p>

<p>Philip made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>“I had a proposal to make to you, but it seems that
it’s no use. I am about to strike out for the mountains,
to try my luck prospecting. A friend of yours,
whom you have never seen or even heard of, suggested
that you might want to go along—as my partner.”</p>

<p>Bromley straightened himself in his chair and the
mocking smile died out of his boyish eyes.</p>

<p>“A friend of mine, you say? I had some friends
while my thousand lasted, but I haven’t any now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have at least one; though, as I have said,
you have never seen or heard of her.”</p>

<p>The play-boy sank back into the depths of his chair.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see; a woman, and you told her about me.
Am I such an object of pity as that, Trask?”</p>

<p>Philip forgot his New England insularity for a
moment and put his hand on the play-boy’s knee.</p>

<p>“It was angelic pity, Bromley. Surely that needn’t
hurt your pride.”</p>

<p>“Angels,” was the half-musing reply. “They can
rise so much, so infinitely much, higher than a man
when they hold on, and sink so much lower when they
let go. This angel you speak of—is she yours, Trask?”</p>

<p>“No; only an acquaintance. I have met her only
twice. But you haven’t said what you think of my
proposal. It is made in good faith.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see how impossible it is?”</p>

<p>“Why is it impossible?”</p>

<p>“A partnership presupposes mutual contributions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
I have nothing to contribute; not even skill with a
miner’s pick.”</p>

<p>“You have yourself and your two hands—which are
probably not more unskilled than mine, for the kind
of work we’d have to do.”</p>

<p>“But the outfit—the grub-stake?”</p>

<p>“I have money enough to carry the two of us
through the summer. If we strike something, you
can pay me back out of your half of the stake.”</p>

<p>For quite a long time Bromley sat with his head
thrown back, and with the half-burned cigar, which
had gone out and was cold and dead, clamped between
his teeth. And his answer, when he made it, was
strictly in character.</p>

<p>“What a hellish pity it is that I didn’t find you and
try to hold you up weeks ago, Trask—while I had some
few ravellings of the thousand left. Will you take a
beggar with you on your quest of the golden fleece?
Because, if you will, the beggar is yours. We mustn’t
disappoint the angel.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> August sun had dropped behind a high-pitched
horizon of saw-tooth peaks and broken ranges, leaving
the upper air still shot through with a golden glow
that was like the dome lighting of a vast celestial
theater, by the time two young men, whose burro packs
of camp equipment, supplies and digging tools marked
them as prospectors, had picked their way down the
last precipitous rock slide into a valley hemmed in by
the broken ranges. At the close of a hard day’s march
the straggling procession was heading for running
water and a camp site; the water being a clear mountain
stream brawling over its rocky bed in the valley
bottom. Reaching the stream before the upper-air
effulgencies had quite faded into the smoke-gray of
twilight, a halt was made and preparations for a night
camp briskly begun.</p>

<p>Two full months had elapsed since the partnership
bargain had been struck in the lobby of the American
House in Denver, and during the greater part of that
interval Philip and the play-boy had prospected diligently
in the foot-hills and eastern spurs of the Continental
Divide, combing the gulches in the vicinity of
Fair Play and Alma, and finding nothing more significant
than an occasional abandoned tunnel or shaft,
mute evidences that others had anticipated their own
disappointment in this particular field. Drifting southwestward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
past Mount Princeton, they had ascended
Chalk Creek, crossed the range over a high pass into
Taylor Park, and were now in new ground on the
western side of the Divide.</p>

<p>“This side of the world looks better; or at least a
little less shopworn,” Bromley remarked, after they had
cooked and eaten their supper and were smoking bed-time
pipes before the camp fire. “I think we have outrun
the crowd, at last, and that is something to be
thankful for.”</p>

<p>Philip opened his pocket knife and dug with the
blade into the bowl of his pipe to make it draw better.
The two months of outdoor life and hard manual labor
had done for him what the treasure search was doing
for many who had never before known what it was
to lack a roof over their heads at night, or to live on a
diet of pan-bread and bacon cooked over a camp fire.
With the shedding of the white collar and its accompaniments
and the donning of flannel shirt, belted
trousers and top boots had come a gradual change in
habits and outlook, and—surest distinguishing mark
of the tenderfoot—a more or less unconscious aping
of the “old-timer.” Since his razor had grown dull
after the first week or two, he had let his beard grow;
and for the single clerkly cigar smoked leisurely after
the evening meal, he had substituted a manly pipe filled
with shavings from a chewing plug.</p>

<p>Bromley had changed, too, though in a different way.
Two months’ abstention from the hectic lights and
their debilitating effects had put more flesh and better
on his bones, a clearer light in his eyes and a springy
alertness in his carriage; and though his clothes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
as workmanlike as Philip’s, he contrived to wear them
with a certain easy grace and freedom, and to look fit
and trim in them. Also, though his razor was much
duller than Philip’s, and their one scrap of looking-glass
was broken, he continued to shave every second
day.</p>

<p>“I’ve been wondering if a later crowd, with more
‘savvy’ than we have, perhaps, won’t go over the same
ground that we have gone over and find a lot of stuff
that we’ve missed,” said Philip, after the pipe-clearing
pause.</p>

<p>“‘Savvy,’” Bromley chuckled. “When we started
out I was moved to speculate upon what the wilderness
might do to you, Phil; whether it would carve a lot
of new hieroglyphs on you, or leave you unscarred in
the security of your solid old Puritan shell. ‘Savvy’
is the answer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go and hire a hall!” Philip grumbled good-naturedly.
“Your vaporings make my back ache.
Give us a rest!”</p>

<p>“There it is again,” laughed the play-boy. “Set the
clock back six months or so and imagine yourself saying,
‘Go hire a hall,’ and ‘Give us a rest!’ to a group of
the New England Trasks.”</p>

<p>“Humph! If it comes to that, you’ve changed some,
too, in a couple of months,” Philip countered.</p>

<p>“Don’t I know it? Attrition—rubbing up against
the right sort of thing—will occasionally work the
miracle of making something out of nothing. You’ve
rubbed off some of your New England virtues on me;
I’m coming to be fairly plastered with them. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
are even times when I can almost begin to look back
with horror upon my young life wasted.”</p>

<p>“Keep it up, if you feel like it and it amuses you,”
was the grunted comment. “I believe if you were
dying, you’d joke about it.”</p>

<p>“Life, and death, too, are a joke, Philip, if you can
get the right perspective on them. Have you ever, in
an idle moment, observed the activities of the humble
ant, whose ways we are so solemnly advised to consider
for the acquiring of wisdom? Granting that
the ant may know well enough what she is about, according
to her lights, you must admit that her apparently
aimless and futile chasings to and fro—up one
side of a blade of grass and down the other, over a
pebble and then under it—don’t impress the human
beholder as evidences of anything more than mere
restlessness, a frantic urge to keep moving. I’ve often
wondered if we human ants may not be giving the
same impression to any Being intelligent enough to
philosophize about us.”</p>

<p>“This feverish mineral hunt, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that, and pretty nearly everything else we do.
‘Life’s fitful fever,’ Elizabethan Billy calls it—and he
knew. But in one way we have the advantage of the
ant; we can realize that our successive blades of grass
and pebbles are all different.”</p>

<p>“How, different?”</p>

<p>“We put the day that is past behind us and step into
another which is never the same. Or, if the day is the
same, we are not. You’ll never be able to go back to
the peace and quiet of a railroad desk, for example.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not. And you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“God knows. As I have said, you’ve rubbed off
some of your virtues on me—suffering some little loss
of them yourself, I fancy. We’ll see what they will
do to me. It will be something interesting to look
forward to.”</p>

<p>“Umph!” Philip snorted; “you’re getting grubby
again—maggoty, I mean. Which proves that it’s time
to hit the blankets. If you’ll look after the jacks and
hobble them, I’ll gather wood for the fire.”</p>

<p>Bromley sat up and finished freeing his mind.</p>

<p>“Philip, if anybody had told me a year ago that
within a short twelve-month I’d be out here in the
Colorado mountains, picking, shovelling, driving jack-asses,
cooking at least half of my own meals, and liking
it all ... well, ‘liar’ would have been the mildest
epithet I should have chucked at him. Comical, isn’t
it?” And with that he went to valet the burros.</p>

<p>The first day after their arrival in the western valley
was spent in exploring, and they finally settled upon a
gulch not far from their camp of the night before as
the most promising place in which to dig. Though
they had as yet mastered only the bare rudiments of a
trained prospector’s education, the two summer months
had given them a modicum of experience; enough to
enable them to know roughly what to look for, and
how to recognize it when they found it.</p>

<p>The gulch in which they began operations was a
miniature canyon, and the favored site was indicated
by the half-hidden outcropping of a vein of brownish
material which they could trace for some distance up
the steep slope of the canyon wall. During the day’s
explorations they had frequently tested the sands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the stream bed for gold “colors,” washing the sand
miner-fashion in their frying pan, and it was upon the
hint given by the “colors” that they had pitched upon
the gulch location. Below the gulch mouth microscopic
flakes of gold appeared now and again in the washings.
But the sands above were barren.</p>

<p>“It looks as if we may have found something worth
while, this time,” Philip hazarded, after they had
cleared the rock face to reveal the extent of the vein.
“The ‘colors’ we’ve been finding in the creek sand come
from a lode somewhere, and this may be the mother
vein. We’ll put the drills and powder to it to-morrow
and see what happens.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, for a toilsome fortnight they drilled
and blasted in the gulch, and by the end of that time
the prospect had developed into a well-defined vein of
quartz wide enough to admit the opening of a working
tunnel. Having no equipment for making field
tests, they could only guess at the value of their discovery,
but the indications were favorable. The magnifying
glass showed flecks and dustings of yellow
metal in selected specimens of the quartz; and, in
addition, the ore body was of the character they had
learned to distinguish as “free milling”—vein-matter
from which the gold can be extracted by the simplest
and cheapest of the crushing processes.</p>

<p>Taking it all in all, they had good reason to be hopeful;
and on the final day of the two weeks of drilling
and blasting they skipped the noonday meal to save
time and were thus enabled to fire the evening round
of shots in the shallow tunnel just before sunset. A
hasty examination of the spoil blown out removed all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
doubt as to the character of the material in which
they were driving. The vein was gold-bearing quartz,
beyond question; how rich, they had no means of
determining; but there were tiny pockets—lenses—in
which the free metal was plainly visible without the
aid of the magnifier.</p>

<p>That night, before their camp fire, they held a council
of war. Though it seemed more than likely that the
lode was a rich one, they were now brought face to
face with the disheartening fact that the mere ownership
of a potential gold mine is only the first step in a
long and uphill road to fortune. In the mining regions
it is a common saying that the owner of a silver
prospect needs a gold mine at his back to enable him
to develop it, and the converse is equally true.</p>

<p>“Well,” Bromley began, after the pipes had been
lighted, “it seems we’ve got something, at last. What
do we do with it?”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew, Harry,” was the sober reply. “If
the thing turns out to be as good as it looks, we’ve got
the world by the tail—or we would have if we could
only figure out some way to hold on. But we can’t
hold on and develop it; that is out of the question. We
have no capital, and we are a good many mountain
miles from a stamp-mill. Unless the lode is richer than
anything we’ve ever heard of, the ore wouldn’t stand
the cost of jack-freighting to a mill.”</p>

<p>“That says itself,” Bromley agreed. “But if we
can’t develop the thing, what is the alternative?”</p>

<p>“There is only one. If our map is any good, and if
we have figured out our location with any degree of
accuracy, we are about thirty miles, as the crow flies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
from Leadville—which will probably mean forty or
fifty the way we’d have to go to find a pass over the
range. We have provisions enough to stake us on the
way out, but not very much more than enough. I cut
into the last piece of bacon to-night for supper.”</p>

<p>“All right; say we head for Leadville. We’d have
to do that anyway, to record our discovery in the land
office. What next?”</p>

<p>“Assays,” said Philip. “We’ll take a couple of sacks
of the quartz along and find out what we’ve got. If the
assays make a good showing, we’ll have something to
sell, and it will go hard with us if we can’t find some
speculator in the big camp who will take a chance and
buy our claim.”</p>

<p>“What?—sell out, lock, stock and barrel for what
we can get, and then stand aside and see somebody
come in here and make a million or so that ought to
be ours?” Bromley burst out. “Say, Philip—that
would be death by slow torture!”</p>

<p>“I know,” Philip admitted. “It is what the poor
prospector gets in nine cases out of ten because, being
poor, he has to take it. If we had a mine, instead of
a mere prospect hole, we might hope to be able to
capitalize it; but as it is—well, you know what’s in
the common purse. My savings are about used up;
we came in on a shoe-string, in the beginning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but, land of love, Philip!—to have a thing,
like this may turn out to be, right in our hands, and
then have to sell it, most likely for a mere song! ...
why, we’d never live long enough to get over it, neither
one of us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>Philip shook his head. “It’s tough luck, I’ll admit;
but what else is there to do?”</p>

<p>Bromley got up and kicked a half burnt log into the
heart of the fire.</p>

<p>“How nearly broke are we, Phil?” he asked.</p>

<p>The financing partner named the sum still remaining
in the partnership purse, which, as he had intimated,
was pitifully small.</p>

<p>“You said, just now, if we had a mine to sell, instead
of a bare prospect,” Bromley went on....
“We’ve got nerve, and two pairs of hands. Suppose
we stay with it and make it a mine? I know good
and well what that will mean: a freezing winter in
the mountains, hardships till you can’t rest, half starvation,
maybe. Just the same, I’m game for it, if you
are.”</p>

<p>Philip rapped the ashes from his pipe and refilled it.
From the very beginning of the summer Bromley had
been offering a series of grateful surprises: dogged
endurance, cheerfulness under privations, willingness
to share hard labor—a loyal partner in all that the word
implied. Slow to admit any one to the inner intimacies
of friendship, as his Puritan heritage constrained him
to be, Philip had weighed and measured the play-boy
coldly, impartially, and before they had been many
weeks together he was honest enough to admit that
Bromley was as tempered steel to his own roughly
forged iron; that it had been merely a lack of an adequate
object in life that had made him a spendthrift
and a derelict.</p>

<p>“You’d tackle a winter here in these mountains
rather than let go?” he said, after the refilled pipe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
was alight. “It will be hell, Harry. You remember
what those fellows in Chalk Creek told us about the
snows on this side of the range.”</p>

<p>“I’m discounting everything but the kind of hell that
will be ours if we should let go and see somebody else
come in and reap where we’ve sown.”</p>

<p>“All right; let’s see what we’ve got to buck up
against. First, we’ll have to go out for the recording,
the assays, and the winter’s provisions. We’d have
to buy at least one more burro to freight the grub-stake
in; and then one of us will have to take the jacks
out for the winter. They’d starve to death here. All
this is going to take time, and the summer is already
gone. And that isn’t all; we’ll have to build a cabin
and cut the winter’s wood. It will be a fierce race
against time to get holed in before we’re snowed
under.”</p>

<p>“Still I’m game,” declared Bromley stoutly. “If it
turns out that we have something worth fighting for—and
the assays will say yes or no to that—I’m for the
fight.”</p>

<p>Philip scowled amiably at the transformed play-boy.
“You nervy little rat!” he exclaimed in gruff affection.
“Think you can back me down on a fighting proposition?
I’ll call your bluff. We’ll put in one more day
setting things to rights, and then we’ll pull out for
Leadville and that starvation winter grub-stake.”</p>

<p>“Setting things to rights,” as Philip phrased it, did
not ask for an entire day. By noon they had cached
their tools and what remained of the stock of provisions
after enough had been reserved to supply them
on the journey; had filled a couple of ore sacks with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
samples for the assay; and had paced off and re-staked
their claim, posting it with the proper notice and
christening it the “Little Jean,”—this at Philip’s suggestion,
though he did not tell Bromley why he chose
this particular name.</p>

<p>With nothing more to be done, Philip was impatiently
eager to break camp at once, but Bromley
pleaded for a few hours’ rest.</p>

<p>“It’s Sunday,” he protested. “Can’t you possess
your soul in patience for one little afternoon? This
bonanza of ours—which may not be a bonanza, after
all—won’t run away. I’d like to sleep up a bit before
we strike out to climb any more mountains.”</p>

<p>The impatient one consented reluctantly to the delay;
and while Bromley, wearier than he cared to admit,
slept for the better part of the afternoon, Philip
dumped the sacked ore and spent the time raking over
the pile of broken rock and vein-matter blasted out
of the shallow opening, selecting other samples which
he thought might yield a fairer average of values.
Beside the camp fire that evening he stretched himself
out with the two sacks of ore for a back rest; and
Bromley, awake now and fully refreshed, noted the
back rest and smiled.</p>

<p>“Like the feel of it, even in the rough, don’t you,
Phil?” he jested. Then: “I’m wondering if this
treasure hunt hasn’t got under your skin in more ways
than one. At first, you were out for the pure excitement
of the chase; but now you are past all that; you
are plain money-hungry.”</p>

<p>“Well, who isn’t?” Philip demanded, frowning into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
the heart of the fire. “Still, you’re wrong. It isn’t
the money so much, as what it will buy.”</p>

<p>“What will it buy—more than you’ve always had?
You won’t be able to eat any more or any better food,
or wear any more clothes, or get more than one tight
roof to shelter you at a time,—needs you have always
had supplied, or have been able to supply for yourself.”</p>

<p>Getting no reply to this, he went on. “Suppose this
strike of ours should pan out a million or so—which is
perhaps as unlikely as anything in the world—what
would you do with the money?”</p>

<p>For the moment Philip became a conventional, traditional
worshipper at the altar of thrift.</p>

<p>“I think I should emulate the example of the careful
dog with a bone; go and dig a safe hole and bury
most of it.”</p>

<p>Bromley’s laugh came back in cachinnating echoes
from the gulch cliffs.</p>

<p>“Not on your life you wouldn’t, Philip. I can read
your horoscope better than that. If it does happen to
happen that we’ve really made a ten-strike, I can see
you making the good old welkin ring till the neighbors
won’t be able to hear themselves think, for the noise
you’ll make.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why you should say anything like
that,” Philip objected morosely.</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t. You’d have to have eyes like
a snail’s to be able to see yourself. But just wait, and
hold my little prophecy in mind.”</p>

<p>Philip, still staring into the heart of the fire, remembered
a similar prediction made by his desk-mate in
the Denver railroad office. “I know your kind....”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Middleton had said. What was there about his kind
that made other people so sure that the good thread
of self-control had been left out in his weaving?</p>

<p>“I’ll wait,” he said; and then: “You haven’t said
what you’d do in case it should turn out that we’ve
made the improbable ten-strike.”</p>

<p>“I?” queried the play-boy. “Everybody who has
ever known me could answer that, off-hand. You
know my sweet and kindly disposition. I wouldn’t
want to disappoint all the old ladies in Philadelphia.
And they’d be horribly disappointed if I didn’t proceed
to paint everything within reach a bright, bright shade
of vermilion.”</p>

<p>Philip looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Nine o’clock,” he announced, “and we start at
daybreak, sharp. I’m turning in.”</p>

<p>In strict accordance with the programme of impatience,
the start was made at dawn on the Monday
morning. Their map, though rather uncertain as to
the smaller streams, seemed to enable them to locate
their valley and its small river, and their nearest practicable
route to Leadville appeared to be by way of the
stream to its junction with a larger river, and then eastward
up the valley of the main stream, which the map
showed as heading in the gulches gashing the western
shoulder of Mount Massive.</p>

<p>A day’s tramping behind the two diminutive pack
beasts brought them to the larger stream, and the third
evening found them zigzagging up the slopes of the
great chain which forms the watershed backbone of
the continent. Philip had been hastening the slow
march of the burros all day, hoping to reach the pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
over the range before night. But darkness overtook
them when they were approaching timber line and they
were forced to camp. It was at this high camp that
they had the unique experience of melting snow from a
year-old snowbank at the end of summer to water the
burros and to make coffee over their camp fire. And
even with double blankets and the tarpaulins from the
packs, they slept cold.</p>

<p>Pushing on in the first graying light of the Thursday
dawn, they came to the most difficult stretch of mountain
climbing they had yet encountered: a bare,
boulder-strewn steep, gullied by rifts and gulches in
which the old snow was still lying. At the summit of
the rugged pass, which they reached, after many
breathing halts, a little before noon, there was a deep
drift, sand-covered and treacherous, and through the
crust of this the animals broke and floundered, and
finally did what over-driven burros will always do—got
down and tried to roll their packs off. It was then
that Philip flew into a rage and swore savagely at the
jacks; at which Bromley laughed.</p>

<p>“You’re coming along nicely, Phil,” he chuckled.
“A few more weeks of this, and you’ll be able to
qualify for a post-graduate course in the higher profanities.
Not but what you are fairly fluent, as it is.”</p>

<p>Philip made no reply; he was silent through the
scarcely less difficult descent into a wide basin on the
eastern front of the range. On the lower level the
going was easier, and in the latter half of the afternoon
they came to the farther lip of the high-pitched basin
from which they could look down into the valley of the
Arkansas; into the valley and across it to a distant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
shack-built camp city spreading upward from a series
of gulch heads over swelling hills with mighty mountains
for a background—the great carbonate camp
whose fame was by this time penetrating to the remotest
hamlet in the land. A yellow streak winding
up one of the swelling hills marked the course of the
stage road, and on it, in a cloud of golden dust, one of
the rail-head stages drawn by six horses was worming
its way upward from the river valley.</p>

<p>“Think we can make it before dark?” Bromley
asked.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to make it,” Philip declared doggedly;
adding: “I’m not going to wait another day before I
find out what we’ve got in that hole we’ve been digging.
Come on.”</p>

<p>The slogging march was resumed, but distances are
marvelously deceptive in the clear air of the altitudes,
and darkness was upon them before the lights of the
big camp came in sight over the last of the hills.
Bromley, thoroughly outworn by the three-days’ forced
march coming upon the heels of two weeks of drilling
and blasting and shovelling, had no curiosity sharp
enough to keep him going, after the burros had been
stabled and lodgings had been secured in the least
crowded of the hotels; but Philip bolted his supper
hastily and announced his intention of proceeding at
once in search of an assay office.</p>

<p>“You won’t find one open at this time of night,”
the play-boy yawned. “There’s another day coming,
or if there isn’t, it won’t matter for any of us.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, I’m not going to wait!” Philip snapped
impatiently; and he departed, leaving Bromley to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
smoke and doze in the crowded and ill-smelling hotel
office which also served as the bar-room.</p>

<p>It was perhaps an hour later when Bromley, who, in
spite of the noise and confusion of the place, had been
sleeping the sleep of utter exhaustion in his chair in
the corner of the smoke-befogged bar-room, was
awakened by a shot, a crash of glass and a strident
voice bellowing, “<i>Yippee!</i> That’s the kind of a hellion
I am! Walk up, gen’lemen, an’ le’s irrigate; the
drinks’re on me. Th’ li’l’ ol’ prospect hole’s gone an’
turned an ace an’ I’m paintin’ the town. <i>Yippee!</i>
Line up, gen’lemen, an’ name yer pizen. Big Ike’s
buyin’ fer th’ crowd!”</p>

<p>Vaguely, through the smoke fog, Bromley saw a
burly miner, bearded like a fictional pirate, beckoning
the bar-room crowd up to the bar, weaving pistol in
hand. Possibly, if he had been fully awake, he would
have understood that the easy way to avoid trouble
with a manifestly drunken roisterer was by the road
of quietly following the example of the others. But
before he could gather his faculties the big man had
marked him down.</p>

<p>“Hey, there—yuh li’l’ black-haired runt in th’ corner!
Tail in yere afore I make yuh git up an’ dance
fer th’ crowd!” he shouted. “I’m a rip-snortin’ hell-roarer
fr’m ol’ Mizzoo, an’ this is my night fer flappin’
my wings—<i>yippee!</i>”</p>

<p>Bromley was awake now and was foolish enough to
laugh and wave the invitation aside airily. Instantly
there was a flash and crash, and the window at his
elbow was shattered.</p>

<p>“L-laugh at me, will yuh!” stuttered the half-crazed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
celebrator. “Git up an’ come yere! I’m goin’ to make
yuh drink a whole durn’ quart o’ red-eye fer that!
Come a-runnin’, I say, afore I——”</p>

<p>The door opened and Philip came in. He had heard
the shot, but was wholly unprepared for what he saw;
Bromley, his partner, white as a sheet and staggering
to his feet at the menace of the revolver in the drunken
miner’s fist; the shattered window and bar mirror; the
group of card players and loungers crowding against
the bar, and the barkeeper ducking to safety behind it.</p>

<p>In the drawing of a breath a curious transformation
came over him. Gone in an instant were all the inhibitions
of a restrained and conventional childhood and
youth, and in their room there was only a mad prompting
to kill. At a bound he was upon the big man, and
the very fierceness and suddenness of the barehanded
attack made it successful. With his victim down on the
sawdust-covered floor, and the pistol wrested out of his
grasp, he swung the clubbed weapon to beat the fallen
man over the head with it and would doubtless have had
a human life to answer for if the bystanders had not
rushed in to pull him off with cries of “Let up,
stranger—let up! Can’t you see he’s drunk?”</p>

<p>Philip stood aside, half-dazed, with the clubbed revolver
still grasped by its barrel. He was gasping, not
so much from the violence of his exertions as at the
appalling glimpse he had been given of the potentialities
within himself; of the purely primitive and savage
underman that had so suddenly risen up to sweep away
the last vestiges of the traditions, to make his tongue
like a dry stick in his mouth with a mad thirst for
blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>It was Bromley who drew him away, and nothing
was said until they had climbed the rough board stair
and Bromley was lighting the lamp in the room they
were to share. Then, in an attempt to lessen the strain
under which he knew his companion was laboring, he
said: “It’s lucky for me that you didn’t have your real
fighting clothes on, that night when I tried to hold
you up, Philip. There wouldn’t have been anything
left of me if you had really meant business. Did you
find an assay shop?”</p>

<p>Philip dropped into a chair and nodded. “A sampling
works that runs night and day. We’ll get the
results in the morning.”</p>

<p>“For richer?—or poorer?”</p>

<p>“I wish to God I knew! I showed the assayer some
of the quartz, but he wouldn’t commit himself; he
talked off; said you could never tell from the looks of
the stuff; that the bright specks we’ve been banking on
might not be metal at all. God, Harry!—if it were
only morning!” he finished, and his eyes were burning.</p>

<p>“Easy,” said Bromley soothingly. “You mustn’t
let it mean so much to you, old man. You’ve worked
yourself pretty well up to the breaking point. There
are plenty of other gulches if ours shouldn’t happen to
pan out. Get your clothes off and turn in. That’s the
best thing to do now.”</p>

<p>Philip sprang up and began to walk the floor of the
small bed-room.</p>

<p>“Sleep!” he muttered, “I couldn’t sleep if the salvation
of the whole human race hung upon it.” Then:
“We’re simpletons, Harry; damned tenderfoot simpletons!
We never ought to have left that claim—both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
of us at once. How do we know that there isn’t a
land office nearer than Leadville where it can be registered?
How do we know we won’t find claim jumpers
in possession when we go back?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You know you are only borrowing
trouble. What’s the use?”</p>

<p>“It’s the suspense.... I can’t stand it, Harry! Go
to bed if you feel like it; I’m going back to the sampling
works and see that quartz put through the mill—see
that they don’t work any shenanigan on us. I
believe they’re capable of it. That slant-eyed superintendent
asked too many questions about where the
stuff came from to suit me. Go on to bed. I’ll bring
you the news in the morning.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">V</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> level rays of the morning sun were struggling
in through a dusty and begrimed bed-room window
when Bromley awoke to find Philip in the room; a
Philip haggard and hollow-eyed for want of sleep,
but nevertheless fiercely, exultantly jubilant.</p>

<p>“Wake up!” he was shouting excitedly. “Wake up
and yell your head off! We’ve struck rich pay in that
hole in the gulch!—do you hear what I’m saying?—pay
rock in the ‘Little Jean’!”</p>

<p>Bromley sat up in bed, hugging his knees.</p>

<p>“Let’s see where we left off,” he murmured, with a
sleepy yawn. “I was headed for bed, wasn’t I? And
you were chasing back to the assay shop to hang, draw,
quarter and gibbet the outfit if it shouldn’t give us a
fair shake. I hope you didn’t find it necessary to
assassinate anybody?”</p>

<p>“Assassinate nothing!”—the news-bringer had
stripped off coat and shirt, and was making a violent
assault upon the wash-stand in the corner of the room.
“Didn’t you hear what I said? We’ve struck it—struck
it big!” Then, punctuated by vigorous sluicings
of cold water: “The ‘Little Jean’s’ a thundering bonanza ...
six separate assays ... one hundred and
sixty-two dollars to the ton is the lowest ... the
highest’s over two hundred. And it’s free-milling ore,
at that! Harry, we’re rich—heeled for life—or we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
are going to be if we haven’t lost everything by acting
like two of the most footless fools on God’s green
earth.”</p>

<p>“‘We have left undone those things which we ought
to have done, and we have done those things which we
ought not to have done, and there is no health in us,’”
quoted the play-boy, thrusting his legs out of bed and
groping for his clothes. “For what particular sin do
we pray forgiveness?”</p>

<p>“For leaving that claim of ours out of doors with
nobody to watch it,”—this out of the mufflings of the
towel. “It gives me a cold sweat every time I think
of what may have happened since we left; what may be
happening right now, for all we know!”</p>

<p>“What could happen?” Bromley queried. “It is our
discovery, isn’t it? And we have posted it and are here
to record it and file on it according to law.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but good Lord! Haven’t you been in these
mountains long enough to know that possession is
nine points of the law where a mining prospect is concerned?
I knew it, but I took a chance because I
thought we had that country over across the range
pretty much to ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Well, haven’t we?”</p>

<p>“No; the woods are full of prospectors over there,
so they told me at the sampling works; we just didn’t
happen to run across any of them. Did you ever hear
of a man named Drew?”</p>

<p>“You mean Stephen Drew, the man who bought the
‘Snow Bird’ for five millions?”</p>

<p>“That’s the man. He happened to be down at the
sampling works this morning when our assays were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
handed out. I guess I made a bleating idiot of myself
when I saw what we had. Anyway, Mr. Drew remembered
meeting me in the railroad offices in Denver and
he congratulated me. One word brought on another.
He asked me if we wanted to sell the claim, and I told
him no—that we were going back to work it through
the winter. He said that was the proper thing, if we
could stand the hardships; that if we did this and
pulled through, he’d talk business with us next spring
on a partnership or a lease.”</p>

<p>“Good—immitigably good!” chirruped Bromley.
“And meanwhile?”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, we take out our legal papers and get
back to that gulch as quick as the Lord will let us.
Mr. Drew shook his head when I told him how we had
left things. He said we’d be lucky if we didn’t find a
bunch of mine jumpers in possession when we got
back; that there were plenty of thugs in the mountains
who wouldn’t scruple to take a chance, destroy our
posted notice and stick up one of their own, and then
fight it out with us when we turned up, on a basis of
might making right. I mentioned our rights and the
law, and he smiled and said: ‘You are a long way
from the nearest sheriff’s office over there, and you
know the old saying—that possession is nine points of
the law. Of course, you could beat them eventually,
but the courts are slow, and you would be kept out of
your property for a long time. Take my advice, and
get back there as soon as you can.’ I told him we’d
go back right away and be there waiting for him next
spring.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!” Bromley groaned in mock dismay;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
“have we got to hit that terrible trail again without
taking even a couple of days to play around in?”</p>

<p>“Hit it, and keep on hitting it day and night till we
get there!” was the mandatory decision. “If you are
ready, let’s go and eat. There is a lot to be done, and
we are wasting precious time.”</p>

<p>It was at the finish of a hurried breakfast eaten in
the comfortless hotel dining-room that Bromley took
it upon himself to revise the programme of headlong
haste.</p>

<p>“You may as well listen to reason, Phil,” he argued
smoothly. “The land office won’t be open until nine
o’clock or after; and past that, there is the shopping for
the winter camping spell. You are fairly dead on your
feet for sleep; you look it, and you are it. You go back
to the room and sleep up for a few hours. I’ll take my
turn now—do all that needs to be done, and call you
when we’re ready to pull our freight.”</p>

<p>Philip shook his head in impatient protest. “I can
keep going all right for a while longer,” he asserted
obstinately.</p>

<p>“Of course you can; but there is no need of it. We
can’t hope to start before noon, or maybe later; and it
won’t take more than one of us to go through the motions
of making ready. You mog off to your downy
couch and let me take my turn at the grindstone.
You’ve jolly well and good had yours.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Philip yielded reluctantly. Then: “Late in
the season as it is, there will be a frantic rush for our
valley as soon as the news of the ‘Little Jean’ discovery
leaks out. Mr. Drew warned me of this, and he cautioned
me against talking too much here in Leadville;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
especially against giving any hint of the locality.
You’ll look out for that?”</p>

<p>Bromley laughed. “I’m deaf and dumb—an oyster—a
clam. Where can I find this Mr. Stephen Drew
who is going to help us transmute our hard rock into
shiny twenty-dollar pieces next spring?”</p>

<p>Philip gave him Drew’s Leadville address, and then
went to climb the ladder-like stair to the room with
the dirty window, where he flung himself upon the unmade
bed without stopping to undress, and fell asleep
almost in the act. When next he opened his eyes the
room was pitchy dark and Bromley was shaking him
awake.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” he gasped, as Bromley struck
a match to light the lamp; and then: “Good God,
Harry!—have you let me waste a whole day sleeping?”</p>

<p>“Even so,” was the cheerful reply. “I’ll tell you
about it while you’re sticking your face into a basin of
cold water. To make it short—the way you did this
morning—the cat’s out of the bag. This whole town
knows that there has been a big gold strike made on
the other side of the range. What it hasn’t found out
yet is who made the strike, or where it is located. Mr.
Drew put me on.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” Philip groaned. “And we’ve lost
hours and hours!”</p>

<p>“They’re not lost; they’ve only gone before. Friend
Drew is responsible. He said, since the news had got
out, we would better wait until after dark to make our
start, and then take the road as quietly as we could;
so I let you sleep. So far, as nearly as Mr. Drew could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
find out, we haven’t been identified as the lucky
discoverers.”</p>

<p>“That will follow, as sure as fate!” Philip predicted
gloomily.</p>

<p>“Maybe not. While there’s life there’s hope. I’ve
paid our bill here at the hotel, and we’ll go to a restaurant
for supper. Everything is done that needed to
be done; claim recorded, grub-stake bought, jacks
packed and ready to move, and a couple of tough little
riding broncos, the horses a loan from Mr. Drew, who
pointed out, very sensibly, that we’d save time and
shoe-leather by riding in, to say nothing of leg weariness.
Drew has one of his hired men looking out for
us at the livery stable where the horses and jacks are
put up, and this man will give us a pointer if there
is anything suspicious in the wind. If you are ready,
let’s go.”</p>

<p>As unobtrusively as possible they made their way
down the steep stair to pass out through the office-bar-room.
As they entered the smoky, malodorous public
room Philip thought it a little odd that there were no
card players at the tables. A few of the evening
habitués were lined up at the bar, but most of them
were gathered in knots and groups about the rusty
cast-iron stove in which a fire had been lighted. With
senses on the alert, Philip followed Bromley’s lead.
There was an air of palpitant excitement in the place,
and, on the short passage to the outer door, snatches of
eager talk drifted to Philip’s ears; enough to make it
plain that the new gold strike was responsible for the
group gathering and the excitement.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet a hen worth fifty dollars that Hank Neighbors—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
big cuss leanin’ up ag’inst the bar—knows
who struck it, and whereabouts it’s located,” was one
of the remarks that he overheard; and, glancing back
from the door, he saw the man to whom the reference
was made—a tall, loose-jointed man, with deep-set,
gloomy eyes and a curling brown beard that masked
something more than half of his face.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the hotel, Bromley led the way down
Harrison Avenue toward a restaurant not far from
the stable where their outfit waited for them. With the
mining excitement now at its most populous height,
and the sidewalks filled with restless throngs of men,
there was curiously little street disorder; this though
the saloons, dance-halls and gaming rooms of a wide-open
mining-camp city were running full blast, their
garishly lighted entrances lacking even the customary
slatted swing doors of concealment. For the greater
part, the crowds were good-natured and boisterously
hilarious; and where the not too infrequent drunken
celebrator came weaving along, the sidewalk jostlers
gave him room, shouting such encouragements as
“Walk a chalk, old boy!” or “Go it while you’re young—when
you’re old you can’t!” One of the staggerers
who bumped against Philip and his partner was repeating
monotonously: “’Rah for Jimmie Garfield—canal
boy, b’gosh—nexsht presh’dent!” an exotic injection
of the politics of a campaign year into an
atmosphere as remote as that of another planet from
matters political or governmental.</p>

<p>In the side-street restaurant Philip chose a table in
a corner and sat with his back to the wall so that he
could see the length and breadth of the room. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
hour was late, and the tables were no more than half
filled; but where there were groups of two or more,
there was eager talk.</p>

<p>“It’s here, too,” Philip commented in low tones,
indicating the eager and evidently excited groups at
the other tables.</p>

<p>“It is everywhere, just as I told you. The town is
sizzling with it. When I was a little tad I used to sit
goggle-eyed listening to the tales of a cousin of ours
who was one of the returned California Forty-niners.
I remember he said it was that way out there. A camp
would be booming along fine, with everybody happy
and contented, until word of a new strike blew in.
Then the whole outfit would go wild and make a frantic
dash for the new diggings. It’s lucky nobody has
spotted us for the discoverers. We’d be mobbed.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could be sure we haven’t been spotted,”
said Philip, a wave of misgiving suddenly submerging
him.</p>

<p>“I think we are safe enough, thus far,” Bromley
put in, adding: “But it was a mighty lucky thing that
we came in after dark last night with those sacks of
samples. If it had been daytime——”</p>

<p>The Chinese waiter was bringing their order, and
Bromley left the subjunctive hanging in air. Philip
sat back while the smiling Celestial was arranging the
table. As he did so, the street door opened and closed
and he had a prickling shock. The latest incomer was
a tall man with sunken eyes and a curly brown beard
masking his face; the man who had been leaning
against the bar in the Harrison Avenue hotel, and who
had been named as Hank Neighbors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“What is it—a ghost?” queried Bromley, after the
Chinaman had removed himself.</p>

<p>“It is either a raw coincidence—or trouble,” Philip
returned. “A fellow who was in the bar-room of the
hotel as we passed through has just come in. He is
sitting at a table out there by the door and looking the
room over ... and trying to give the impression that
he isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he has followed us?”</p>

<p>“It is either that or a coincidence; and I guess we
needn’t look very hard for coincidences at this stage
of the game.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know who he is, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, but I know his name. It’s Neighbors. Just as
we were leaving the hotel, one of the bar-room crowd
named him; pointed him out to his fellow gossips as a
man who probably knew who had made the new gold
strike, and where it is located.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Bromley began, “if there is only one of
him——”</p>

<p>“If there is one, there will be more,” Philip predicted.
Then, at a sudden prompting of the primitive
underman: “I wish to goodness we had something
more deadly than that old navy revolver we’ve been
lugging around all summer.”</p>

<p>Bromley’s smile was cherubic.</p>

<p>“As it happens, we are perfectly well prepared to
back our judgment—at Mr. Drew’s suggestion. Our
arsenal now sports a couple of late model Winchesters,
with the ammunition and saddle holsters therefor. I
bought ’em and sneaked ’em down to the stable this
afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>Philip looked up with narrowed eyes. “Would you
fight for this chance of ours if we’re pushed to it,
Harry?”</p>

<p>Bromley laughed.</p>

<p>“I’ll shoot any man’s sheep that’ll try to bite me.
Have you ever doubted it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know.”</p>

<p>“How about you?”</p>

<p>“I have never fired a rifle in my life; not at anything—much
less at a man. But if I had to——”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Bromley with a grin. “You’re a chip
off the old Puritan block. If the occasion should arise,
you’d tell your New England conscience to look the
other way, take cold-blooded aim, pull trigger and let
the natural law of expanding gases take its course.
But we mustn’t be too blood-thirsty. If we are followed
to-night it needn’t be a foregone conclusion that
the trailers are going to try to take our mine away from
us. It is much more likely they’ll be tagging along to
do a little hurry stake-driving of their own, after we’ve
shown them the place.”</p>

<p>Philip had drained his second cup of coffee. “If
you are through?” he said; and as they left the restaurant
he shot a quick glance aside at the man who either
was, or was not, a coincidence. To all appearances,
suspicion had no peg to hang upon. The Neighbors
person was eating his supper quietly, and he did not
look up as they passed him on their way to the street.</p>

<p>At the stable they found Drew’s man; a young fellow
who looked like a horse-wrangler, and who dressed
the part, even to a pair of jingling Mexican spurs with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
preposterous rowels, and soft leather boots with high
heels.</p>

<p>“Everything lovely and the goose hangs high,” he
told them; and as they were leading the loaded jacks
and the saddle animals out: “The big boss said I was
to ride herd on yuh till yuh got out o’ town. He
allowed it’d be safer if yuh didn’t go pee-radin’ down
the Avenoo.”</p>

<p>In silence they followed their mounted guide through
the lower part of the town and so came, by a rather
long and dodging detour, into the rutted stage road at
some distance beyond the last of the houses. Here
their pace-setter turned back and they went on alone.
It was a moonless night, but they had no trouble in
following the well-used road over the hills and down
to the valley of the Arkansas.</p>

<p>At the river crossing, however, the difficulties began.
Though hardly more than a mountain creek at this
short distance from its source, the river still held
hazards in places for a night crossing with loaded pack
animals, and it was some little time before they found
the shallows through which they had led the burros the
previous evening. Just as they reached and recognized
the crossing place they heard the sound of galloping
hoofs, and Philip jerked his rifle out of its saddle
scabbard and began to fumble the breech mechanism.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot!” Bromley warned; and when the
single horseman closed up they saw that he was the
guide who had piloted them out of Leadville.</p>

<p>“Sashayed out to tell yuh there’s a bunch a-trailin’
yuh,” he announced laconically. “Five of ’em, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
Hank Neighbors headin’ the procession. Must’ve
got onto yuh, some way.”</p>

<p>“Did you see them?” Philip asked.</p>

<p>“Passed ’em as I was goin’ back, and circled round
to get ahead of ’em.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a man is this Neighbors?”</p>

<p>“Minin’ man, is what he lets on to be.”</p>

<p>“Straight or crooked?”</p>

<p>“You can’t prove nothin’ by me. But if I was you-all,
I’d try to make out to lose him and his pardners
in the shuffle somewheres betwixt here and wherever
it is you’re a-headin’ for. I shore would.”</p>

<p>“Have they horses?” Bromley inquired.</p>

<p>“Yep; and three jacks, packed same as yourn.”</p>

<p>“Then they can’t make any better time than we can,”
Philip put in.</p>

<p>“That depends on how much time yuh make and
how much yuh lose. But that don’t make no difference.
They can trail yuh, if yuh don’t figger out
some trick to throw ’em off.”</p>

<p>“Are they armed?” Philip asked.</p>

<p>The horse-wrangler chuckled at the tenderfoot
naïveté of the question.</p>

<p>“Folks don’t trail round much in this neck o’ woods
without totin’ their artillery. Leastways, a <i>hombre</i>
like Hank Neighbors don’t. Far as that goes, you-all
seem to be pretty well heeled yourselves.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try to hold up our end of the log,” Philip
boasted. Then: “If they’re chasing us, I guess we’d
better be moving along. Much obliged for your
trouble—till you’re better paid. Get hold of that
canary’s halter, Harry, and we’ll pitch out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>The river crossing was made in safety, and, to their
great relief, they had little difficulty in finding their
way to the high basin. Since the trail threaded a dry
gulch for the greater part of the ascent, there were
only a few stretches where they had to dismount and
lead the horses, so not much time was lost. Nevertheless,
it was past midnight when they reached the easier
travelling through the basin toward the pass of the
crusted snowdrifts. Riding abreast where the trail
permitted, they herded the jacks before them, pushing
on at speed where they could, and slowing up only in
places where haste threatened disaster.</p>

<p>“What’s your notion, Phil?” Bromley asked, when,
in the dark hour preceding the dawn, they found themselves
at the foot of the precipitous climb to the pass.
“Don’t you think we’d better camp down and wait for
daylight before we tackle this hill?”</p>

<p>Philip’s reply was an emphatic negative. “We can
make it; we’ve got to make it,” he declared. “If those
people are chasing us, they can’t be very far behind, and
if we stop here they’ll catch up with us. And if we let
them do that, we’d never be able to shake them off.”</p>

<p>“As you like,” Bromley yielded, and the precipitous
ascent was begun.</p>

<p>With anything less than tenderfoot inexperience for
the driving power, and the luck of the novice for a
guardian angel, the perilous climb over a trail that was
all but invisible in the darkness would never have been
made without disaster. Convinced by the first half-mile
of zigzagging that two men could not hope to
lead five animals in a bunch over an ascending trail
which was practically no trail at all, they compromised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
with the necessities and covered the distance to the
summit of the pass twice; once to drag the reluctant
broncos to the top, and again to go through the same
toilsome process with the still more reluctant pack
animals. It was a gruelling business in the thin, lung-cutting
air of the high altitude, with its freezing chill;
and when it was finished they were fain to cast themselves
down upon the rocky summit, gasping for breath
and too nearly done in to care whether the animals
stood or strayed, and with Bromley panting out,
“Never again in this world for little Henry Wigglesworth!
There’ll be a railroad built over this assassinating
mountain range some fine day, and I’ll just
wait for it.”</p>

<p>“Tough; but we made it,” was Philip’s comment.
“We’re here for sunrise.”</p>

<p>The assertion chimed accurately with the fact. The
stars had already disappeared from the eastern half of
the sky, and the sharply outlined summits of the distant
Park Range were visible against the rose-tinted
background of the coming dawn. In the middle distance
the reaches of the great basin came slowly into
view, and in the first rays of the rising sun the ground
over which they had stumbled in the small hours of
the night spread itself map-like below them. Far down
on the basin trail a straggling procession of creeping
figures revealed itself, the distance minimizing its
progress so greatly that the movement appeared to be
no more than a snail’s pace.</p>

<p>“You see,” Philip scowled. “If we had camped at
the foot of this hill it would have been all over but the
swearing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>Bromley acquiesced with a nod. “You are right.
What next?”</p>

<p>“We have our lead now and we must hold it at all
costs—get well down into the timber on the western
slope before they can climb up here. Are you good
for more of the same?”</p>

<p>“A bit disfigured, but still in the ring,” said the play-boy,
with his cheerful smile twisting itself, for very
weariness, into a teeth-baring grin. Then, as the sunlight
grew stronger, he made a binocular of his curved
hands and looked back over the basin distances. As he
did so, the twisted smile became a chuckling laugh.
“Take another look at that outfit on the trail, Phil,”
he said. “It’s my guess that they have a pair of field-glasses
and have got a glimpse of us up here.”</p>

<p>Philip looked, and what he saw made him scramble
to his feet and shout at the patient jacks, lop-eared and
dejected after their long night march. The group on
the distant trail was no longer a unit. Three of the
dots had detached themselves from the others and were
coming on ahead—at a pace which, even at the great
distance, defined itself as a fast gallop.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">VI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the vanguard of the army of eager gold-hunters
fairly in sight, the two who were pursued cut the
summit breathing halt short and resumed their flight.
Avoiding the sand-covered snowdrifts in which they
had come to grief on the journey out, they pushed on
down the western declivities at the best speed the
boulder-strewn slopes and craggy descents would permit,
postponing the breakfast stop until they reached a
grassy glade well down in the foresting where the animals
could graze.</p>

<p>After a hasty meal made on what prepared food they
could come at easily in the packs, and without leaving
the telltale ashes of a fire, they pressed on again westward
and by early afternoon were in the mountain-girt
valley of the stream which had been their guide
out of the western wilderness two days earlier. Again
they made a cold meal, watered and picketed the animals,
and snatched a couple of hours for rest and sleep.
Scanting the rest halt to the bare necessity, mid-afternoon
found them once more advancing down the valley,
with Philip, to whom horseback riding was a new and
rather painful experience, leading his mount.</p>

<p>One by one, for as long as daylight lasted, the urgent
miles were pushed to the rear, and after the sun had
gone behind the western mountains they made elaborately
cautious preparations for the night. A small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
box canyon, well grassed, opened into the main valley
on their left, and in this they unsaddled the horses and
relieved the jacks of their packs and picketed the animals.
Then, taking the needed provisions from one of
the packs, they crossed the river by jumping from
boulder to boulder in its bed, and made their camp fire
well out of sight in a hollow on the opposite bank; this
so that there might be no camp signs on the trail side of
the stream. But in the short pipe-smoking interval
which they allowed themselves after supper, Bromley
laughed and said: “I guess there is a good bit of the
ostrich in human nature, after all, Philip. Here we’ve
gone to all sorts of pains to keep from leaving the remains
of a camp fire in sight, when we know perfectly
well that we are leaving a plain trail behind us for
anybody who is even half a woodsman to follow.
That’s a joke!”</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” Philip agreed; and for a time
before they extinguished the fire and recrossed the
river to roll up in their blankets in the box canyon
where the animals were grazing, they discussed the
pressing matter of trail effacement without reaching
any practical solution of the problem.</p>

<p>The next morning they were up and on their way in
the earliest dawn twilight. As yet, there were no signs
of the pursuit. The mountain silences were undisturbed
save by the drumming thunder of the swift little
river and the soft sighing of the dawn precursor breeze
in the firs. Convinced that all the haste they were making
was clearly so much effort thrown away unless they
could devise some means of throwing their followers
off the track, they resumed the camp-fire discussion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
falling back in the end, not upon experience, which
neither of them had, but upon the trapper-and-Indian
tales read in their boyhood. In these, running water
was always the hard-pressed white man’s salvation in
his flight, and, like the fleeing trapper, they had their
stream fairly at hand. But the mountain river, coursing
along at torrent speed, and with its bed thickly
strewn with slippery boulders, was scarcely practicable
as a roadway; it was too hazardous even for the sure-footed
broncos, and entirely impossible for the loaded
jacks.</p>

<p>Next, they thought of cutting up one of the pack
tarpaulins and muffling the hoofs of the animals with
the pieces, but aside from the time that would be
wasted, this expedient seemed too childish to merit
serious consideration. In the end, however, chance,
that sturdy friend of the hard-pressed and the inexperienced,
came to their rescue. Some seven or eight
miles beyond their night camp they came upon a place
where, for a half-mile or more, the left-hand bank of
the stream was a slope of slippery, broken shale; the
tail of a slide from the mountain side above. Bromley
was the first to see the hopeful possibilities.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Phil,” he called to his file leader;
“don’t you remember this slide, and how we cursed it
when we had to tramp through it coming out? I’ve
captured an idea. I believe we can delay this mob
that’s chasing us, and maybe get rid of it for good and
all. Is the river fordable here, do you think?”</p>

<p>Philip’s answer was to ride his horse into the stream
and half-way across it. “We can make it,” he called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
back, “if we can keep the jacks from being washed
away.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take that for granted,” said Bromley. “But
we don’t need to go all the way across. Stay where
you are, and I’ll herd the rest of the caravan in and
let it drink.”</p>

<p>This done, and a plain trail thus left leading into
the water, Bromley explained his captured idea. While
they couldn’t hope to make a roadway of the stream bed
for any considerable distance, it was quite possible
to wade the animals far enough down-stream to enable
them to come out upon the shale slide. After they had
been allowed to drink their fill, the expedient was tried
and it proved unexpectedly successful. On the shale
slide the hoof prints vanished as soon as they were
made, each step of horse or burro setting in motion a
tiny pebble slide that immediately filled the depression.
Looking back after they had gone a little distance they
could see no trace of their passing.</p>

<p>“This ought to keep the mob guessing for a little
while,” Bromley offered as they pushed on. “They’ll
see our tracks going down into the creek, and think
we crossed over. They’ll probably take a tumble to
themselves after a while—after they fail to find any
tracks on the other side; but it will hold ’em for a bit,
anyway. Now if we could only scare up some way of
hiding our tracks after we get beyond this slide——”</p>

<p>Though the continuing expedient did not immediately
suggest itself, the good-natured god of chance
was still with them. Before they came upon ground
where the tracks of the animals would again become
visible, they approached the mouth of one of the many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
side gulches scarring the left-hand mountain, and in
the gulch there was a brawling mountain brook with a
gravelly bottom.</p>

<p>“This looks as if it were made to order, don’t you
think?” said Philip, drawing rein at the gulch mouth.
“If we turn up this gulch we can walk the beasts in
the water.”</p>

<p>“But that isn’t the way we want to go,” Bromley
objected.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure about that. The map shows our
valley lying on the other side of this southern mountain
range. The route we took, coming out, was along
two sides of a triangle, following the streams—which
is the long way around. I’m wondering if we couldn’t
cut straight across and save a lot of time. We’ve
climbed worse mountains than this one looks to be.
And there’s another thing: we can take the water trail
up this gulch for a starter, and the chances are that
we’d lose the hue and cry that’s following us—lose it
permanently. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I’m good for a try at it, if you are,” was the
prompt reply; and so, without more ado, the route was
changed.</p>

<p>For the first half-mile or so through the windings of
the gulch they were able to hide their tracks in the
brook bed, but the farther they went, the rougher the
way became, until finally they had to drag the horses
and pack animals up out of the ravine and take to the
mountain slopes, zigzagging their way upward as best
they could through the primeval forest. Luckily,
though there were craggy steeps to be climbed with
shortened breath, perilous slides to be avoided, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
canyon-like gulches to be headed at the price of long
detours, they encountered no impassable obstacles, and
evening found them far up in the forest blanketing of
the higher slopes, with still some little picking of grass
for the stock and with plenty of dry wood for the camp
fire which they heaped high in the comforting assurance
that its blaze would not now betray them.</p>

<p>It was after they had cooked and eaten their first
hearty meal of the toilsome day, and had stretched
themselves luxuriously before the fire for the evening
tobacco-burning, that Bromley said: “How about it,
Philip?—are you getting a bit used to the millionaire
idea by this time?”</p>

<p>Philip shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>“No, Harry; I can’t fully realize it yet. For a little
while after I saw the figures of those assays I thought
I could. But now it seems more like an opium dream.
It doesn’t seem decently credible that after only a short
summer’s knocking about in these hills, two raw green-horns
like ourselves could stumble upon something that
may change the entire scheme of things for both of us
for the remainder of our lives. It’s fairly grotesque,
when you come to think of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it isn’t a dream, at any rate. Mr.
Drew gave me a good bit of his time day before yesterday;
went with me to the land office, and afterward
helped me in the horse market where I bought the extra
burro. He asked a lot of questions; about the width
of the vein, how far we had traced it, and how fair or
unfair we’d been to ourselves in picking the samples;
and after I had answered him as well as I could, he
said, in effect, that we had the world by the neck, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
we would have, if the ‘Little Jean’ pans out anywhere
near as good as it promises to.”</p>

<p>Again Philip shook his head. “I’m not at all sure
that I want to grab the world by the neck, Harry.
That doesn’t seem like much of an ambition to me.”</p>

<p>“All right; say it doesn’t. What then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. If the miracle had happened a
year or so ago ... but it didn’t; so what’s the use?”</p>

<p>“Go on and turn it loose,” Bromley encouraged.
“Set the clock back a year or so and let us see what
it strikes.”</p>

<p>“I had a few ideals then; modest ones, I guess you’d
call them. I’d had to break my college course in the
third year—family matters. At that time I wanted
nothing so much as to go back and finish; and perhaps
have a try for a Ph.D. degree afterward.”</p>

<p>“And past that?”</p>

<p>“More of what you’d call the modesties, I guess: a
teaching job in some college back home, or something
of that sort; a job in which I’d have some leisure for
reading, thinking my own thoughts, living my own
life.”</p>

<p>“No wife and kiddies in the picture?” Bromley
asked, with his most disarming smile.</p>

<p>“No; not then.”</p>

<p>The play-boy laughed softly. “No sentimental
foolishness for the austere young student and pedagogue,
of course. But the ‘not then’ tells a different
story. You’ve met the incomparable ‘her’ in your later
avatar?”</p>

<p>It was some measure of the distance he had come on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
the road to freer human expression that Philip did
not at once retreat into the speechless reticences.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said: “I’ve met a girl.”</p>

<p>“The ‘angel’ you spoke of, the night you fed a hungry
hold-up?”</p>

<p>“Don’t get it wrong. She is not so angelic that
she can’t be perfectly human.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t you say you’d met her only twice?”</p>

<p>“I did; and the saying still holds true.”</p>

<p>“Bowled you over like a shot, did she? I’d never
have believed it of you, Philip.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t believe it now. There was no ‘bowling
over’ about it. I first met her on the train coming
to Denver—with her family; sat with her for part of
an afternoon. She isn’t like any other girl I’ve ever
known.”</p>

<p>“And that is as far as you’ve gone? You are a
cold-blooded fish, Philip, dear. But we were talking
about futures. I take it the teaching job in a New
England college doesn’t appeal to you now; or won’t
if our mine keeps its promise?”</p>

<p>“Honestly, Harry, I can’t see very far ahead. I’m
not at all sure that I want to go back and finish my
college course. There is nothing truer than the saying
we have hurled at us all the time out here—that
the West lays hold of a man and refuses to let go;
that you may be as homesick as the devil, but you’ll
never go home to stay. But this is all dream stuff—this
talk. We haven’t got the millions yet. Even if
the mine is as rich as it seems to be, we may find jumpers
in possession, and so many of them that we can’t
get away with them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“That’s so. ‘There’s many a slip,’ as we read in the
copy-books.”</p>

<p>For a time the high-mountain silence, a silence curiously
bereft of even the small insect shrillings of the
lower altitudes, enveloped them. The cheerful fire
was beginning to fall into embers when Philip began
again.</p>

<p>“A while back, you thought the money fever was
getting hold of me, Harry, but I hope you were wrong.
Of course, there are things I want to do; one in particular
that money would help me to do. It was my
main reason for heading west from New Hampshire
a little less than a year ago.”</p>

<p>“Is it something you can talk about?”</p>

<p>“I guess so—to you,” and, breaking masterfully
through whatever barrier of the reticences remained,
he told the story of his father’s disappearance, of the
cloud which still shadowed the Trask name, of his own
unshakable belief in his father’s innocence, and, lastly,
of his determination to find the lost man and to clear
the family name.</p>

<p>“You see how the money will help; how I couldn’t
hope to do much of anything without money and the
use of my own time,” he said in conclusion. Then,
the ingrained habit of withdrawal slipping back into
its well-worn groove: “You won’t talk about this,
Harry? You are the only person this side of New
Hampshire who knows anything about it.”</p>

<p>“It is safe enough with me, Phil; you ought to know
that, by this time. And here is my shy at the thing:
if it so happens that the ‘Little Jean’ is only flirting
with us—that we get only a loaf of bread where we’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
hoping to hog the whole bakery—you may have my
share if your own isn’t big enough to finance your job.
I owe you a good bit more than the ‘Little Jean’ will
ever pan out on my side of the partnership.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hell,” said Philip; and the expression was
indicative of many things not written down in the book
of the Philip who, a few months earlier, had found it
difficult and boyishly embarrassing to meet a strange
young woman on the common ground of a chance train
acquaintanceship. Then, “If you’ve smoked your pipe
out, we’d better roll in. There is more of the hard
work ahead of us for to-morrow.”</p>

<p>But the next morning they found, upon breaking
camp and emerging from the forest at timber line,
that the blessing of good luck was with them still
more abundantly. With a thousand and one chances
to miss it in their haphazard climb, they had come
upon an easily practicable pass over the range; and
beyond the pass there was a series of gentle descents
leading them by the middle of the afternoon into a
valley which they quickly recognized as their own.</p>

<p>Pushing forward at the best speed that could be
gotten out of the loaded pack animals, they traversed
the windings of the valley with nerves on edge and
muscles tensed, more than half expecting to find a
struggle for re-possession awaiting them in the treasure
gulch. At the last, when the more familiar landmarks
began to appear, Philip drew his rifle from its
holster under his leg and rode on ahead to reconnoitre,
leaving Bromley to follow with the jacks. But in a
few minutes he came galloping back, waving his gun
in the air and shouting triumphantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“All safe, just as we left it!” he announced as he
rode up. And then, with a laugh that was the easing
of many strains: “What a lot of bridges we cross
before we come to them! Here we’ve been sweating
blood for fear the claim had been jumped—or at least
I have—and I don’t suppose there has been a living
soul within miles of it since we left. Kick those canaries
into action and let’s get along and make camp
on the good old stamping ground.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> autumn days were growing perceptibly shorter
when the discoverers of the “Little Jean” lode began to
make preparations to be snowed in for the winter in
the western mountain fastnesses. By this time they
had heard enough about the mountain winters to know
what they were facing. With the first heavy snowfall
blocking the passes they would be shut off from the
world as completely as shipwrecked mariners on a
desert island. But hardships which are still only anticipatory
hold few terrors for the inexperienced; and
with the comforting figures of the assays to inspire
them, they thought more of the future spring and its
promise than of the lonely and toilsome winter which
must intervene.</p>

<p>Since there was still sufficient grass in sheltered
coves and forest glades to feed the stock, they postponed
the journey which one of them would have to
take to find winter quarters for the animals. The delay
was partly prudential. Though each added day of
non-interference was increasing their hope that their
ruse at the shale slide had been completely successful
in throwing their pursuers off the track, they had no
reason to assume that the Neighbors party would turn
back without making an exhaustive search for the
new “rich diggings”; and Philip was cannily distrustful
of the Neighbors purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“It may be just as you say: that they are merely
hungry gold-chasers, breaking their necks to be the
earliest stake-drivers in a new district; but then, again,
they may not be,” was the way he phrased it for the
less apprehensive Bromley. “If they happen to be the
other sort—the lawless sort—well, with both of us
here to stand up for our rights, they’d be five to our
two. We can’t afford to make the odds five to one.
I’d rather wait and take the horses and jacks over the
range in a snow storm than to run the risk of losing
our mine.”</p>

<p>“Meaning that we needn’t lose it if we can muster
two to their five?” said Bromley, grinning.</p>

<p>“Meaning that if anybody tries to rob us there’ll be
blood on the moon. Get that well ground into your
system, Harry.”</p>

<p>“Ho! You are coming on nicely for a sober, peaceable
citizen of well-behaved New England,” laughed
the play-boy. “But see here, didn’t you tell me once
upon a time that you had never fired a gun? If you
really believe there is a chance for a row, you’d better
waste a few rounds of ammunition finding out what a
gun does when you aim it and pull the trigger. It’s
likely to surprise you. I’ve shot ducks in the Maryland
marshes often enough to know that pretty marksmanship
is no heaven-born gift.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” returned Philip grimly. “That is a
sensible idea. Evenings, after we knock off work, we’ll
set up a target and you can give me a few lessons.”</p>

<p>Making the most of the shortening days, they had
become pioneers, felling trees for the building of a
cabin, and breaking the two broncos, in such primitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
harness as they could contrive out of the pack-saddle
lashings, to drag the logs to a site near the tunnel
mouth. Like the drilling and blasting, axe work and
cabin building were unfamiliar crafts, to be learned
only at a round price paid in the coin of aching backs,
stiffened muscles and blistered palms. Nevertheless,
at the end of a toiling fortnight they had a one-room
cabin roofed in, chimneyed and chinked with clay, a
rude stone forge built for the drill sharpening and
tempering, and a charcoal pit dug, filled and fired to
provide the forge fuel. And though the working days
were prolonged to the sunset limit, Philip, methodically
thorough in all things, did not fail to save enough daylight
for the shooting lesson, setting up a target in the
gulch and hammering away at it until he became at
least an entered apprentice in the craft and was able
to conquer the impulse to shut both eyes tightly when
he pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>They were bunking comfortably in the new cabin
when they awoke one morning to find the ground
white with the first light snowfall. It was a warning
that the time had come to dispose of the animals if they
were not to be shut in and starved. In his talk with
Bromley, Drew, the Leadville mine owner, had named
a ranch near the mouth of Chalk Creek where the
borrowed saddle horses could be left, and where winter
feeding for the jacks might be bargained for; and
after a hasty breakfast Philip prepared to set out on
the three-days’ trip to the lower altitudes.</p>

<p>“I feel like a yellow dog, letting this herding job
fall on you, Phil,” protested the play-boy, as he helped
pack a haversack of provisions for the journey. “I’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
make you draw straws for it if I had the slightest idea
that I could find the way out and back by myself.”</p>

<p>“It’s a stand-off,” countered the potential herd-rider.
“I feel the same way about leaving you to hold the
fort alone. If that Leadville outfit should turn up
while I’m away——”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about the Neighbors bunch. It’s
been three full weeks, now, with no sign of them.
They’ve lost out.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that. Better keep your eye
peeled and not get too far away from the cabin. If
they should drop in on you——”</p>

<p>“In that case I’ll man the battlements and do my
small endeavors to keep them amused until you put
in an appearance,” was the lighthearted rejoinder.
“But you needn’t run your legs off on that account.
They’ve given us up long ago.” Then, as Philip
mounted and took the halter of the horse that was to
be led: “Are you all set? Where’s that old pistol?”</p>

<p>“I don’t need the pistol. If I’ve got to walk back,
lugging my own grub and blankets, I don’t want to
carry any more weight than I have to.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, you’re going prepared to back your
judgment,” Bromley insisted; and he brought out the
holstered revolver and made Philip buckle it on.
“There; that looks a little more shipshape,” he approved.
“Want me to go along a piece and help you
start the herd?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind,” Philip refused; and thereupon
he set out, leading the extra horse and driving the
jacks ahead of him.</p>

<p>It was his intention to back-track over the trail by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
which they had first penetrated to their valley in the
late summer, and being gifted with a fairly good sense
of direction, he found his way to the foot of the first
of the two enclosing mountain ranges without much
trouble. But on the ascent to the pass the difficulties
multiplied themselves irritatingly. The trail was blind
and the snow was fetlock deep for the animals. The
led horse was stubborn and hung back; and wherever
a widening of the trail permitted, the jacks strayed
and scattered. Philip’s temper grew short, and by the
time he had reached the high, wind-blown, boulder-strewn
notch which served as the pass over the spur
range, he was cursing the scattering burros fluently
and fingering the butt of the big revolver in an itching
desire to bullet all three of them.</p>

<p>“Damn your fool hides!” he was yelling, oblivious
of everything but the maddening impossibility of towing
the reluctant bronco astern and at the same time
keeping the long-eared stupidities ahead in any kind
of marching order; “Damn your fool——”</p>

<p>He stopped short, swallowing the remainder of the
shouting malediction and flushing shamefacedly under
his summer coat of tan. Seated beside the trail on a
flat-topped boulder from which the snow had been
brushed was a thick-chested, bearded giant of a man
making his much-belated midday meal on a sandwich
of pan-bread and bacon; a grinning witness of the
outbreak of ill-temper. As Philip drew rein the giant
greeted him jovially.</p>

<p>“Howdy, pardner! Yuh must ’a’ had a heap o’
book-learnin’ to be fitten to cuss thataway. Don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
blame yuh, though. It’s one hell-sweatin’ job to herd
canaries when they ain’t got no packs on ’em.”</p>

<p>Philip stared hard at the big man, his excellent memory
for faces serving him slowly but surely. When he
spoke it was to say: “People are always telling us this
is a little world, and I’ll believe it, after this. Don’t
you remember me?—and the K.P. train last spring?”</p>

<p>The thick-chested giant got upon his feet</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be dawg-goned! Sure I ricollect! You’re
the young feller I told to hump hisself and go sit with
the li’l’ black-eyed gal that had the sick daddy. Put
’er there!” and he gave Philip’s hand a grip that made
the knuckles crack.</p>

<p>Philip slid from the saddle, smiling a sheepish
apology.</p>

<p>“Sorry I had to come on the scene swearing like
an abandoned pirate, but these chicken-brained jacks
have just about worn me out. Queer we should stumble
upon each other in this God-forsaken place. Where
do you come from?”</p>

<p>“Hoofed it up from the Aspen diggin’s. Aimin’ to
get out o’ the woods afore I get snowed under and
can’t. You ain’t had all the bad luck. Yiste’day I lost
my canary, pack, blankets and all, in the Roarin’ Fork.
Li’l’ cuss slipped and rolled into the creek and I didn’t
get to save nothin’ but the old Winchester I was totin’
and a li’l’ bite o’ bread and meat I had in my pockets.
Box o’ matches went with the hide and taller, and I’d
’a’ slep’ cold last night if I hadn’t run onto a bunch
o’ Leadville men back yonder a piece and hunkered
down afore their fire.”</p>

<p>Philip started at the mention of the Leadville men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
but he deferred the question that rose instantly to his
lips.</p>

<p>“You are going out by way of the pass over the main
range at the head of Chalk Creek?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Aimin’ to get out thataway; yes.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’m headed that way, too, and, as you
see, I have one more horse than I can ride. I’ll give
you a lift, if you say so.”</p>

<p>The big man’s laugh was like the rumbling of distant
thunder.</p>

<p>“If I say so? Say, young feller me lad, I ain’t got
but one mouth, but I reckon if I had a dozen of ’em
they’d all be sayin’ so at once,” he affirmed gratefully.
“Want to pitch out right now?”</p>

<p>“No; I’ll eat first. Didn’t want to stop until I got to
the top of the pass.”</p>

<p>Philip unslung his provision haversack and spread
the contents on the flat rock. Over the meal, which
he invited the wayfarer to share with him, he got the
story of the bearded man’s summer; weary months
of prospecting in the western slope wilderness with
nothing to show for it, not even the specimens from
the few putative discoveries he had made, since these
had gone to the bottom of the Roaring Fork with the
drowned burro.</p>

<p>“Hard luck,” Philip commented, when the brief tale
of discouragement had been told. “What will you
do now?”</p>

<p>“Same as every busted prospector does: hunt me a
winter job in a smelter ’r stamp-mill and sweat at it
till I get enough spondulix ahead to buy me another
grub-stake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Go to work as a day-laborer?”</p>

<p>“You’ve named it. Minin’s the only trade I know;
and the mills ain’t payin’ miner’s wages for shovelin’
ore into the stamps.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you try for a job in one of the big
mines?”</p>

<p>The giant’s laugh rumbled again.</p>

<p>“Not me—I ain’t that kind of a miner—ain’t wearing
no brass collar for a corp’ration! Gone too long
without it. But lookee here, you ain’t told me nothin’
about yerself. I didn’t allow you was aimin’ to turn
into a mount’in man when I rid the cars with yuh last
spring.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t,” said Philip; and thereupon he gave a
short account of the summer’s wanderings up to, but
not including, the discovery of the “Little Jean,” and
entirely omitting all mention of Bromley’s part in the
wanderings. That his story did not explain his presence
on the outward trail with two saddle horses, three
jacks and no tools or camp equipment, he was well
aware; but the canny traditions were warning him not
to betray the carefully guarded secret of the “Little
Jean” to a chance travelling companion.</p>

<p>“Tough luck, all round,” said the big man half
absently; and Philip saw plainly enough that he was
trying to fit the present moment’s inconsistencies into
the story. Then: “Still and all, somebody’s had good
luck over here in this hell’s back kitchen. I heard about
it in the camp o’ them Leadville pardners last night.”</p>

<p>“What did you hear?” Philip asked, and his nerves
were prickling.</p>

<p>“They said two young fellers, tenderfoots, both of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
’em, hoofed it into Leadville two-three weeks ago with
some stuff that run away up yonder in the assays—rotten
quartz and free gold.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Philip, still with nerves on edge, “that
sort of thing is happening every day, isn’t it? What
more did you hear?”</p>

<p>“They was talkin’ ’mongst theirselves—not to me.
The news had leaked out, like it always does, and they’d
trailed the young fellers, a ridin’ two broncs and
herdin’ three loaded jacks, acrosst the range and over
here. Then they’d lost the trail somehow. From what
I picked up, I allowed they was aimin’ to stay till they
found it ag’in, if it took all winter.”</p>

<p>Philip’s tongue was dry in his mouth when he said:
“Whereabouts were these Leadville people camped?”</p>

<p>“About ten mile north, at the mouth of a li’l’ creek
that runs into the Fork.”</p>

<p>There was one more question to be asked, and Philip
was afraid to ask it. Yet he forced himself to give it
tongue.</p>

<p>“You say you camped with these fellows last night.
What kind of a crowd was it?”</p>

<p>The big prospector was staring at the three jacks
and two horses as if he were mentally counting them.</p>

<p>“Jist betwixt you and me and the gate-post, it’s a
sort o’ tough outfit. Hank Neighbors is headin’ it, and
if half o’ what they tell about him is so, he’s plum
bad medicine.”</p>

<p>“Not prospectors, then?”</p>

<p>“W-e-l-l, you might call ’em so; but I reckon they’re
the kind that lets other folks do most o’ the hard work
o’ findin’ and diggin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“You mean they’re ‘jumpers’?”</p>

<p>“Least said’s soonest mended. But if I had a right
likely prospect anywheres in these here hills, I’d shore
hate like sin to have ’em run acrosst it.”</p>

<p>Philip’s resolve was taken upon the instant. From
what had been said he knew precisely where the
Neighbors camp was; it was only a few miles below
the gulch of the “Little Jean”; so few that the campers
may well have heard the crashes of the evening rifle
practice. And Bromley was standing guard alone.</p>

<p>“See here,” he began, suddenly reversing all former
resolutions of canny secrecy; “I don’t know you—don’t
even know your name. But I believe you are an honest
man, and I’m going to tell you something: I’m one of
the tenderfoots Neighbors is trying to trail.”</p>

<p>The wayfaring prospector greeted the information
with a wide-mouthed smile.</p>

<p>“Yuh didn’t hardly need to tell me that—with them
five critturs standin’ there a-hangin’ their heads, and
you without any camp stuff ’r tools, and with two
saddle hosses where yuh didn’t need only one. What’s
yer game?”</p>

<p>Being fairly committed now, Philip went the entire
length—with nothing hopeful to build upon save the
big miner’s rough chivalry as he had seen it manifested
in the Kansas Pacific day-coach months before.
Frankly filling the blanks he had left in his earlier
account of the summer’s experiences, he wound up with
an anxious question:</p>

<p>“What am I to do? I can’t go on and leave my partner
to stand off this robber gang alone. They’ll find
our claim before I could get back. It’s our own creek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
they’re camping on, right now!” Then: “You say you
are going out by way of Chalk Creek. I have a little
money left; it isn’t much, but it’s all yours if you’ll
take these horses and jades out to Nachtrieb’s ranch
in the South Park and leave them there. Then I can
go back from here and take my share of what’s coming
to us.”</p>

<p>The big man got up and brushed the crumbs from his
clothes.</p>

<p>“I can beat that all holler, if you’ll say the word.
I sort o’ like your looks—liked ’em last spring when I
chucked yuh in the seat with the li’l’ black-eyed gal.
Yuh say yo’re aimin’ to hole up for the winter and
work yer claim. S’pose yuh give me a job along with
you and yer pardner and lemme go back with yuh? I
can hold steel ’r pound it, and han’le powder. More’n
that, I can shoot middlin’ straight when I aim to.”</p>

<p>“You mean you’d stand with us if the Neighbors
bunch should try to jump our claim?”</p>

<p>“Why, suree! Yuh don’t reckon I’d go back on my
bread and meat, do yuh?”</p>

<p>“But these beasts—what’s to be done with them?”</p>

<p>“I was comin’ to that. There’s a li’l’ ranch six-seven
mile in the park ahead of us; it’s the place where I was
aimin’ to get enough grub to walk out on. Queer old
squatter runs it; li’l’ mite cracked in his upper story
on religion, they say. He’ll winter the stock for yuh.”</p>

<p>“Still, that isn’t all,” Philip went on desperately.
“We have laid in provisions for the winter, my partner
and I; all we could afford to buy. The stake is enough
for two, but if there are three of us, we’ll go short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
before spring. Besides, we haven’t enough money
left to pay your wages.”</p>

<p>“Ne’m mind about the wages; they can wait. If
half o’ what they’re sayin’ about this here strike o’
yourn is so, there’ll be ore enough on the dump, come
spring, to pay all the bills—and then some, I reckon.
All I’ll ask’ll be a chance to stake a claim somewheres
round next to yourn, maybe.”</p>

<p>“You won’t have to ask anybody’s permission to do
that,” Philip put in. “But still there is the question
of the short grub-stake.”</p>

<p>The big man grinned cheerfully. “Might trust in the
Lord a li’l’ bit, mightn’t we? Maybe He’ll send us a
short winter. Anyhow, I’ll take my chance o’ starvin’;
it won’t be the first time by a long chalk. Whadda yuh
say? Is it a go?”</p>

<p>It was far enough from Philip’s normal promptings
to decide anything so momentous without due and
thoughtful consideration. But the exigencies had suddenly
become urgent. In his mind’s eye he could see
the Neighbors gang of desperadoes besieging the log
cabin, with its scanty garrison of two untrained defenders.
One additional loyal pair of eyes and hands
might turn the scale. Hasty decisions, headlong initiative,
were the very essence of the time, and of the
treasure-seekers’ existence. Impulsively he thrust out
a bargain-clinching hand.</p>

<p>“It’s a go, if you want to throw in with us, and I’ll
promise you you won’t lose anything by it,” he said.
“What may I call you?”</p>

<p>“Name’s Garth—‘Big Jim,’ for short.”</p>

<p>“Mine is Philip Trask. We are strangers to each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
other, but that’s an even stand-off. I’m banking on
you for what you did for the little girl on the train.
Let’s hurry and find that park ranch you speak of.
It’s running in my mind that we can’t get back to the
claim any too soon.”</p>

<p>It was after they had mounted and were herding
the jacks down the descending trail that Garth said:
“What about the li’l’ gal with the sick daddy? Ever
see her again?”</p>

<p>“Just once,” Philip returned, “five or six weeks
after they reached Denver. The family was living in
one of the tent colonies, and from what was said, I
judged the father was pretty badly off.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” said Garth. “You hear a heap nowadays
about what the dry air’ll do for them lungers, but the
health boosters tell only half o’ the story. That same
old thin air kills ’em swift if they come too late. It
shore do.”</p>

<p>By pushing the animals as fast as the hazardous
trail would permit, the ranch in the inter-mountain
park was reached in the shank of the afternoon.
Philip made a hurried bargain with the ranch owner,
a white-haired, white-bearded old man who might
have figured as a reincarnation of Elijah the Tishbite;
and after a consultation with Garth, refused the old
man’s offer of a night’s lodging. Garth’s vote was for
an immediate return to the “Little Jean.” The skies
were clear and there would be a moon for at least the
first half of the night.</p>

<p>“We’ve left a trail in the snow that a blind man could
back-track on,” he pointed out. “I’m hep for the night
tramp, if so be you are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Stiff from the long day in the saddle, Philip would
have welcomed a blanket bed before the Tishbite’s
hearth fire, but the urgencies were still acutely upon
him; also, he was beginning to acquire the pride of the
outdoor man. If Garth, who had already tramped
miles before the afternoon meeting on the high pass,
could stand it to keep on going, surely he could.</p>

<p>“We’ll tackle it,” he said shortly; and presently they
were taking the steep mountain trail in reverse, slipping
and sliding in the dry snow, but doggedly making
their way toward the high, wind-swept pass.</p>

<p>Visioning that long night tramp in the moonlight,
afterward, Philip knew it would be an enduring memory
after many other experiences had faded and gone.
The slippery trail; the black shadows of the trees while
they were still in the foresting, and the blacker shadows
of great rocks and gulch cliffs after they had climbed
above timber line; the keen night wind sweeping over
the bleak pass where they paused for a short halt in the
lee of a sheltering boulder to eat a few mouthfuls of
food before hitting the downward trail; the perilous
descent to the headwater gulches of the Roaring Fork,
where more than once he owed his escape from a sudden
plunge into unknown depths to the quick clutch of
the silent giant plodding along tirelessly behind him—no
detail of the deadening, soul-harrowing fight for
endurance, lapsing finally into a sheer effort of the will
to thrust one foot before the other, would ever be
forgotten.</p>

<p>The moon had long since disappeared behind the uplifted
skyline of the western ranges by the time they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
were measuring the last of the weary miles in the
valley of the lucky strike. At the foot of one of the
jutting mountain spurs, Philip broke the slogging
monotony to say: “We’re almost there. The next
gulch is ours.”</p>

<p>“Good enough,” was the muttered comment from the
rear; and then, suddenly: “Hold up—hold your hosses
a minute!”</p>

<p>Philip turned and saw Garth stooping with his rifle
held in the crook of an arm. He was peering down
at the hoof tracks they had been following.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked.</p>

<p>Garth pushed his flap-brimmed hat to the back of his
head and looked up.</p>

<p>“Thought yuh said a while back that this here was
your trail—the one yuh made comin’ out with the
cavoyard this mornin’.”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Not by a jugful—not unless yuh was walking the
hull caboodle of ’em back’ards.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Sure as shootin’. The critters that made this trail
was goin’ the same way we are. Get down and take
a squint for yerself.”</p>

<p>Philip was about to comply when he saw a spurt of
red flame leap out in the up-valley distance, the flash
followed quickly by the reverberating echoes of a rifle
shot. At the flash and crash Garth leaped afoot with
a growled-out imprecation and worked the lever of his
repeating rifle to throw a cartridge into the chamber.</p>

<p>“That means business, son! They’ve called the turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
on us and got yer pardner in the nine-hole! Limber
up that old hoss-pistol o’ yourn and p’int the way to get
into your gulch without bustin’ in at the front door.
That’s our chance—if we’ve got any. Jump to it!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">VIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fairly</span> benumbed by the shock of the discovery
that a battle for the possession of the “Little Jean”
was actually in progress, Philip pointed to the right
up a steep ravine.</p>

<p>“We can c-cross at the head of this draw,” he
stammered, and it made him furious to find that he
could not better control his voice.</p>

<p>“Let’s be moggin’ along, then,” said the man of
action, immediately setting a pace up the wooded ravine
that left Philip a stumbling straggler at his heels.
“They’ve got that pardner o’ yourn holed up somewheres—in
yer cabin, most likely. Reckon he’s got
sand enough to hang on?”</p>

<p>“Harry?—he—he’ll hang on till they kill him!”
Philip panted.</p>

<p>“What-all’s he got for fightin’ tools?”</p>

<p>“Two Winchesters.”</p>

<p>“Good a-plenty. How much furder do we keep to
this here draw?”</p>

<p>“Another hundred yards or so; then bear sharp to
the left.”</p>

<p>Following directions, the big man presently turned
short into the ravine-side forest and began to climb,
pulling himself from tree to tree up the steep acclivity
with an agility that seemed to take no account of his
great size and weight. Breathlessly Philip struggled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
after him, marvelling at the reserves of energy Garth
was able to draw upon after a long day and night of
steady tramping and mountain climbing. For himself,
he was nearly at the collapsing point when they
reached the easier going on the summit of the spur.
As they pressed on, the spattering crackle of rifle fire
came intermittently from the gulch, and at each fresh
outblaze he started nervously and quickened his pace.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, hurry!” he gasped. “They’ll murder
Harry before we get there—if they haven’t already
done it!”</p>

<p>But Garth read the story of the ragged firing with
shrewder intelligence.</p>

<p>“That there powder-burnin’s a good sign,” he commented
calmly. “Hit shows they ain’t got him yet,
and ain’t rushin’ him. Keep me steered right. You
know the lay o’ the land, and I don’t.”</p>

<p>“To your left again, now,” Philip directed. “There’s
a little side gully along here somewhere ... if we can
find it in the dark——”</p>

<p>As capably as if the darkness were interposing no
obstacle, Garth found the head of the dry arroyo and
the descent into the gulch of the mine was begun.</p>

<p>“Right careful, now,” he cautioned; “no slippin’ ’r
slidin’ to make a fuss! Got to work Injun medicine
on that crowd.”</p>

<p>Silently, the snow serving to deaden their footfalls,
they worked their way to the gulch bottom and along its
windings until Philip whispered: “Around the next
turn ahead ... if there’s light enough, you’ll see our
dump and the cabin.”</p>

<p>“Kee-rect,” Garth mumbled. “Stick to the shadders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
and keep that old hoss-pistol handy. Yuh ain’t no ways
back’ard about aimin’ it straight, are yuh?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Philip; but he was promising for the intention
rather than for the ability. He was trembling
like a leaf in the wind. It was one thing to go into
battle on the crest of a wave of berserker rage, and
quite another to face the hazards deliberately and in
cold blood.</p>

<p>With caution redoubled they turned the last of the
jutting promontories obstructing a view of the lower
reaches of the gulch. The young moon had long since
dropped behind the western ranges, but the reflection
of the starlight upon the white mantling of snow made
the dump of broken rock and ore marking the tunnel
site, and beyond it the larger bulking of the cabin,
dimly discernible. Garth thrust a hand backward to
signal a halt, and as he did so, a jet of flame shot from
a thick graving of young firs on the right-hand slope
of the gulch opposite the cabin, and, preceding the
jarring report by a fraction of a second, they heard the
smack of the bullet as it struck its target.</p>

<p>“Reckon I called the turn,” Garth whispered. “Yer
pardner’s holdin’ the cabin ag’in ’em. Ain’t no back
door to that shack, is there?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, there ain’t a ghost of a show for us to make
a run for the front door; they’ve got that plum’ sewed
up. We got to work it some other way. We’d ort to
have one o’ them Winchesters o’ youm and a belt o’
ca’tridges. That old hoss-pistol won’t spit far enough
to do much good.”</p>

<p>“But if we had the rifle?” Philip queried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“Then we might work a li’l’ trick that’d be better
than breakin’ into the cabin: might make them cusses
think the whole U.S. army was after ’em.”</p>

<p>Philip’s heart rose into his throat and threatened to
choke him. On the hurried race across the spur his
teeth had been chattering, and it was only by the supremest
effort that he could keep them from rattling
like castanets now. If the extra rifle was to be secured,
it was his part to stalk the cabin and get it:
Garth couldn’t do it; Bromley wouldn’t surrender the
gun to a stranger—if he were still alive it was more
than likely that he would mistake Garth for one of the
outlaws and kill him if he could find a convenient loophole
through which to shoot.</p>

<p>Philip felt a cold sweat starting out all over his body.
If he could only summon the flaming rage fit that had
possessed him on the night when he had flung himself
upon the drink-crazed prospector in the bar-room of
the Leadville hotel ... he prayed for its return, but
it wouldn’t come. By a curious telepathic prickling he
knew that the big man crouching beside him sensed his
condition, and his shame was complete.</p>

<p>“You skeered?” queried Garth in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>“As scared as hell!” was the gritting reply. “Just
the same, I’m going after that extra gun. What shall
I do after I get it?”</p>

<p>“First off, you tell yer pardner to hold his hand till
he hears the big racket beginnin’, and then to blaze
away like sin at anything in sight. Next, you keep
right on down the gulch and make a round and get on
the hill behind that bunch o’ saplin’s. When you’re all
set and ready, blaze away, and I’ll whale at ’em from up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
here, and yer pardner’ll chip in from the cabin. If
that don’t stampede them cusses, nothin’ will.”</p>

<p>Philip tightened his belt. “I’ll probably get killed
trying, but here’s f-for it,” he stammered; and in a
chilling frenzy of the teeth-chattering he began to
worm his way down the gulch toward the dump and
the cabin.</p>

<p>How he contrived to drag himself over the short
three hundred yards, with every nerve and muscle
straining to turn the advance into a shameful retreat,
he never knew. Every time another gunshot crashed
upon the night silence he fancied he was the target
and flattened himself with the blood slowly congealing
in his veins. None the less he kept on, hugging the
shadows and taking advantage of every inequality of
the ground that would afford even the scantiest cover.</p>

<p>At last, after what seemed like an endless eternity
of the creeping, dodging progress, he found himself
behind the cabin and sheltered by it from the desultory
gunfire which still kept up from the opposite slope of
the gulch. With his pocket knife he dug the clay
chinking from between two of the logs and listened.
There was no sound from within, and again his blood
ran cold. Had one of the random bullets found its
mark and killed Bromley? He remembered, with a
tingling shock of terror, that all of the later firing had
been on the part of the outlaws; there had been no
replies from the cabin.</p>

<p>Hastily enlarging the hole in the chinking, he put
an eye to the orifice. The interior was not wholly dark,
as he had expected to find it. There was a handful of
embers on the hearth, and the glow made a murky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
twilight in the cabin. Presently he made out the slender
figure of the play-boy stretched flat upon the earth
floor, face downward, and the blood-chilling shock
came again. Then he looked more closely and saw
that the prone figure was not that of a dead man.
Bromley was alive and alert; he was lying behind a low
breastwork built of the provision sacks, and he had one
of the rifles at his shoulder with the muzzle thrust
through a crack between the logs. Philip gulped and
shut his eyes. The sudden revulsion from horrified
despair to relief made him blind and dizzy.</p>

<p>Another shot from without steadied him and he
called softly through the opening he had made. Bromley
heard, and recognized his voice.</p>

<p>“You, Philip? How the mischief ... where are
you?”</p>

<p>“At the back—where the chinking is out. Don’t
you see?”</p>

<p>“Coming,” said the one-man garrison, and as he
crawled slowly across the floor Philip could see that
one leg was useless; it was bound with a clumsy handkerchief
tourniquet above the knee and was dragging.</p>

<p>“Damn them!” he whispered fiercely. “How badly
are you hurt, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say; haven’t had time to look at it. But the
honors are easy, so far: I got one of them to pay for
the leg, and got him good—I saw ’em carrying him
off. Where the devil did you drop from?—out of the
blue?”</p>

<p>“Never mind that part of it now. I want one of the
rifles and a belt of ammunition. Hook ’em over here
while I dig this hole big enough to take them through!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>The transfer was quickly made, and with the gun in
his hands, Philip delayed only long enough to get a
briefed story of the attack. Bromley had been routed
out of his bunk about an hour earlier by somebody
hammering on the door. When he opened in answer to
the knocking there was a short and brittle parley.
Neighbors had made a blunt demand for a surrender
of the mining claim, asserting that it was his discovery,
made early in the summer.</p>

<p>“Naturally, I told him to go chase himself,” said the
play-boy. “Then the five of ’em started to rush little
Harry, and one of them got me in the leg with a pistol
shot before I could slam the door and drop the bar.
I punched a hole in the chinking, and a few rounds
from the Winchester drove ’em back into the woods for
cover. They’ve been there—or four of ’em have—ever
since, taking pot shots at the cabin. Now tell me what
happened to make you turn back.”</p>

<p>“Just a piece of good luck—the story will keep till
we’re out of this mess. You’re not fighting alone any
more; there are two of us on the outside. Keep down
and don’t let them get you through the door. Those
slabs won’t stop a rifle bullet.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I found that out?” said Bromley, with a
grim chuckle. “But tell me—what’s the plan of
campaign?”</p>

<p>“This: I’m going to try to circle around and get
behind that bunch of trees where they’ve taken cover.
I’ve picked up a helper—an old prospector and mountain
man that I met last spring. He has his own rifle,
and when the circus begins, you turn loose through
your loophole and pump lead just as fast as you can.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
In that way we’ll get ’em from three directions at once.
Will that hurt leg let you do your part?”</p>

<p>The grim little chuckle came again. “I don’t shoot
with my legs. Wave your little baton and I’ll come in
on the fortissimo passages.”</p>

<p>“That’s all, then. Take care of yourself, and don’t
unbar the door until you are sure we are on the other
side of it. I’m gone.”</p>

<p>While he had the shelter afforded by the cabin there
was some little sense of security. But as soon as he
got beyond this bulwark the shaking fit seized him
again. For the first few yards there was little or no
cover save a few stumps and a pile of firewood, and
behind these he crept, hardly daring to breathe. He
had buckled the filled cartridge belt around him, but
the rifle was an impediment that could not be disposed
of so easily. So long as he must crawl, he had to drag
the weapon along as best he could; and remembering
that he had heard that even a plug of snow will cause
a gun barrel to burst when it is fired, he halted behind
the woodpile and stopped the muzzle of the rifle with
a rag torn from his handkerchief.</p>

<p>From the woodpile to the nearest forest cover on
that side was only a matter of a few rods, but the
interval was bare, and he had to have another fight
with himself before he could drum up the courage to
cross it. Once among the trees, however, he felt safer;
and after he had emerged from the mouth of the gulch
and could take shelter in the groving of aspens that
lined the valley stream, he told himself that the worst
was over.</p>

<p>In the fringe of quaking aspens he stumbled upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
horses and jacks of the invaders, the burros still
standing with their packs on. It was not until he was
fairly among the tethered animals that he remembered
the man that Bromley had shot, and reflected that if
the outlaw was only wounded, he would be somewhere
near the horses. The thought had barely flashed upon
him before he saw the wounded man. He was sitting
with his back to a tree and mumbling curses. Philip
slipped aside cautiously and pushed on, again with
cold chills racing up and down his spine. The wounded
man was evidently only half conscious.... If he had
been fully conscious....</p>

<p>Philip broke into a nervous run, following the stream
for possibly an eighth of a mile before he ventured to
turn aside to climb the slope which should lead to the
outlying position above the thicket in the gulch where
the outlaws were in hiding.</p>

<p>Toiling upward breathlessly, it seemed to take him
a frightfully long time to gain the proper elevation.
Unlike the spur on the western side of the gulch, this
one was thinly wooded and was besprent with a scattering
of boulders; he was in constant fear of dislodging
one of these and thus giving a premature alarm.
With the occasional crack of a rifle in the depths below
to guide him, he finally reached a height from which he
could look down upon the clump of young firs; and
squeezing himself between two of the surface boulders
he pumped the loading lever of the Winchester and
prepared to give the firing signal agreed upon.</p>

<p>It was while he was steadying the rifle over the rock
in front of him that he felt something giving way and
realized that the slight push of his wedged-in body was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
tipping the bulwark boulder over to set it in motion
down the slope. In a frenzy of excitement at this discovery
his only thought was that with the boulder gone
he would lose his sheltering breastwork and be naked
to rifle fire from below. Dropping the gun, he clung
to the tilting rock with both hands and tried to hold it—to
drag it back upon its balancing pinnacle. When his
puny effort failed, and the great rock turned slowly
over to go bounding down the declivity straight for
the sapling grove and carrying a small avalanche of
lesser stones with it, he lost his head completely, snatching
up the rifle and firing it wildly again and again,
and with no attempt at taking aim, until he had pumped
the last cartridge from its magazine. It was this final
shot that did for him. In his mad haste he failed to
hold the gunstock firmly against his shoulder, and at
the trigger-pulling the kick of the weapon slewed him
around with a jerk that snapped his head against the
rock behind him. For a brief instant the black bowl
of the heavens was illuminated by a burst of fiery
stars, and after that he knew nothing more until he
opened his aching eyes upon a graying dawn to find
Garth kneeling beside him, unbuttoning his shirt to
search for the presumptive effacing wound.</p>

<p>At the touch of the big man’s cold hands he sat up,
with the buzzing of many bees in his brain.</p>

<p>“It isn’t there,” he said; “it’s the back of my head.
The gun kicked me against the rock. How long have
I been gone?”</p>

<p>“A hour ’r so. I allowed yuh was scoutin’ round to
see what’d come o’ the jumpers; was why I didn’t come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
a-huntin’ for yuh. Besides, that there game li’l’ pardner
o’ yourn was needin’ to have his laig fixed up.”</p>

<p>“What <i>has</i> become of the jumpers?” Philip asked,
holding his head in his hands in a vain endeavor to
quiet the bees.</p>

<p>Garth sat back on his heels and his wide-mouthed
smile made him look like a grinning ogre.</p>

<p>“Skedaddled; gone where the woodbine twineth an’
the whangdoodle mourneth for her fust-borned, I
reckon. Cattle o’ that sort ain’t makin’ no stand-up
fight, less’n they got the odds <i>all</i> their way. And what
with this here mount’in tumblin’ down on ’em, and
guns a-poppin’ three ways from the ace, they wasn’t
stayin’ to wait for daylight—not any.” Then: “That
was a mighty fly li’l’ trick o’ yourn—shovin’ a rock
slide down at ’em.”</p>

<p>Philip was honest enough not to take credit for a
sheer accident.</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” he denied. “I had jammed myself in between
two rocks to get cover, and I was scared stiff
when I found the front one rolling away from me;
I was even silly enough to grab it and try to hold it
back.”</p>

<p>“Ne’m mind; hit done the business, all the same.”
A pause, and then: “I took a li’l’ squint at yer strike
afore I clim up here. You two boys’ve sure had a
chunk o’ tenderfoot luck! You’ve got the world by
the horns if that streak o’ pay rock don’t play out on
yuh too soon. Hit’s richer’n Billy-be-damn, right from
grass-roots. Time she’s had a winter’s work put in
on ’er, there’ll be money enough on the dump to buy
yuh a whole raft o’ farms in God’s country. Reckon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
that bumped head’ll let yuh drill down to the cabin? Or
shall I h’ist yuh onto my back and tote yuh?”</p>

<p>“I can walk,” said Philip, struggling to his feet.
And after the descent was begun, with Garth’s arm to
steady him: “Harry’s leg—how badly is he hurt?”</p>

<p>“Clean hole, and no bones broke. It’ll lay him out
for a spell, but that’s all.” Then, with the approving
chuckle that Philip was learning to anticipate: “Lordy-goodness!
you couldn’t kill that nervy li’l’ pardner o’
yourn with a axe! And a while back I was foolish
enough in my head to ask yuh if he had sand enough
to hold them pirates till we got to him! Why, say;
he’s all sand—that li’l’ rat is! Just laughed like I was
ticklin’ him when I was diggin’ in that hole in his laig
to clean it out—he did, for a fact! Yuh needn’t never
worry yore head a minute about <i>that</i> boy.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IX</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> beginning of the week after the clash with the
claim jumpers found the routine which the owners of
the “Little Jean” hoped to maintain through the winter
catching its stride. True, Bromley was out of the
activities for the time being; but even as a cripple he
contributed his part by refusing to let Philip or Garth
make a trip afoot to Leadville on the slender chance
of being able to persuade a doctor to cross the ranges
in the perilous edge of the closed season. As to this,
however, a second snowfall, coming almost upon the
heels of the first, shut them off conclusively from the
outer world, and their isolation was complete.</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly all right,” Bromley maintained cheerfully.
“I’m doing fine—couldn’t be doing any better
if I had all the doctors in Leadville. The only thing
that nags me is the fact that I’m tied down and can’t
pull my weight in the boat.”</p>

<p>“You have good and well earned all the time you
have to lose,” was Philip’s retort to this plaint; and
with Garth as an able team-mate he completed the
preparations for the winter, cutting down trees for
firewood, setting up a third bunk in the cabin, and
building a small lean-to for the storing of the provisions
and explosives.</p>

<p>When it came to a resumption of the mining operations,
Philip found that they had acquired much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
than a mere day-laborer in the experienced mining man.
Quite apart from his great strength and apparently
unlimited capacity for hard work, Garth’s practical
knowledge of development processes proved invaluable,
and it was at his suggestion that the tunnel was
straightened and enlarged, its future drainage and
ventilation provided for, and a rough-and-ready process
of hand-picked ore-sorting made a part of each day’s
task.</p>

<p>“You got to look ahead a mile ’r so in this here
minin’ game,” was the experienced one’s business-like
argument. “You let on like you boys ain’t got the
spondulix to buy a stamp-mill and tote it in over the
mount’ins, so you either got to make a stock comp’ny
o’ this bonanza o’ yourn ’r else lease it. Either way
the cat jumps, it’s a-goin’ to pay big if yuh’ve got a
sure-enough mine, with rich ore on the dump, to show
up next spring.”</p>

<p>For two tenderfoots to whom, as yet, all things
mining-wise were unknown quantities, this practical
advice was as water to the thirsty, so the development
work was planned accordingly. By the time Bromley’s
wound had healed and he was able to take his shift as
third man in the heading, the work of drilling and
blasting had been expertly systematized, and the stock
of selected ore was growing day by day.</p>

<p>Speculations as to what had become of the would-be
jumpers died out after the first heavy snowfall, which
blocked, not only the mountain passes, but the high-lying
valley as well. Garth had argued from the
first that, with at least one wounded man in the party,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Neighbors would not try to hold his footing in the
snowbound western wilderness through the winter.</p>

<p>“Now that he knows whereabouts them high-grade
assays o’ yourn come from, he’ll know how to beat
the rush that’s shore goin’ to come chargin’ in here the
minute the passes are open in the spring,” was Garth’s
answer to the speculations; and since the snow blockade,
daily added to, shut all intrusion out, no less effectually
than it shut the occupants of the lonely log
cabin in, the stirring incidents of the night of battle
became only a memory, and the day’s work filled the
cup of the days to overflowing for the three who had
elected to brave the winter in the solitudes.</p>

<p>The severity of the winter of 1880-81 in the mountains
of Colorado had—and still has—for its reminiscent
chroniclers all those who endured the rigors
of that Arctic season. The trio in the high-pitched
valley of the Saguache were not the only mineral-mad
gold-hunters who, deliberately or in tenderfoot hardihood,
disregarded the warnings of the old-timers and
stayed afield, many of them without adequate supplies,
and lacking the skill and experience necessary to successful
pioneering in a snowbound wilderness. As a
consequence, the hard winter took its toll on many a
mountain side and in many an isolated gulch. Snow
slides swept precariously situated log cabins from bare
slopes, or buried them fathoms deep in débris in the
gulches. In the ill-provided camps starvation stalked
abroad; and though there was game to be had, it could
not be pursued without snow-shoes; and few, indeed,
were the neophytes who had had the foresight to include
snow-shoes in their winter camp kits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>As for the three burrowing in the gulch of the
“Little Jean,” the hardships played no favorites, though
Garth’s fund of experience stood them in good stead,
tiding them over many of the exigencies. Before they
became entirely shut in, the big man stalked and shot
a deer: the meat was smoke-cured and added to the
store of provisions, and the skin, Indian-tanned, served
for an extra bunk cover in the cold nights. But with
the coming of the heavier snows deer-stalking became
impossible, so that source of food supply was cut off
for the future.</p>

<p>Fortunately, by the middle of December, by which
time zero-and-below temperatures were clamping the
western slope wilderness in an icy vise, they had driven
the mine tunnel to a depth to which the outdoor frigidities
only partly penetrated; hence they were still able
to carry on the mining operations. But the deepening
drifts in the gulch were now threatening to bury the
small cabin, chimney and all, and no little of their daylight
time was spent in keeping the snow shovelled from
the roof, and the paths open to the tunnel, to the woodpile
and to the creek from which they were still obtaining
their drinking water.</p>

<p>Life under such conditions—complete and unbreakable
isolation, day-long toil, much of which must be
squandered in a bare struggle for existence, and the
constant and wearing demand upon fortitude and endurance—exacts
penalties in whatever coin the debtor
may be able to pay. For Philip Trask, his uneventful
youth and early manhood, with its years running in
the well-worn grooves of tradition and the conventional,
faded and became as the memory of a dream—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
memory which was dimming day by day and withdrawing
into a more and more remote distance.</p>

<p>It was in the long winter evenings before the hearth
fire in the half-buried cabin that he began to understand
that Bromley was humanly and socially the better man;
that there was in him a fine strain of gentle breeding
which not only enabled him to rise superior to environment
and association, but also gave him an outlook
upon life unattainable by the under-gifted. From the
beginning the play-boy had struck up a friendship, or
rather an affectionate comradeship, with Garth that he,
Philip, could not bring himself to share, try as he
might. Little things, even the mountain man’s crudities
of speech, jarred upon him. It was quite in vain
that he called himself hard names, asking himself why
he, of all men, should yield to the nudgings of an
intellectual or social snobbishness. But the fact remained.
Bromley could bridge the social gap between
himself and Garth apparently without effort; could and
did. In the pipe-smoking hours before the cabin fire it
was the play-boy and the bearded frontiersman who
were companions, while Philip found himself sitting
apart and brooding.</p>

<p>“How do you do it, Harry?” he asked, one evening
when Garth, who thought he had seen deer tracks in
the snow, had gone out to the water hole in the creek
to try for a moonlight shot at more meat.</p>

<p>“Do what—chum in with Big Jim? Why shouldn’t
I? He’s a man, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but you and he have absolutely nothing in
common. Garth washes his face occasionally and calls
it a bath; keeps his fingernails in mourning; shovels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
his food with a knife; rolls into his bunk with his boots
on if he happens to forget to take them off.”</p>

<p>Bromley smiled and relighted his pipe.</p>

<p>“You have some queer notions in that narrow old
Puritan head of yours, Phil. Don’t you know that
humanity is all common?”</p>

<p>“Is it?—from your point of view?”</p>

<p>“It’s the surest thing you know. ‘For a’ that an’ a’
that, a man’s a man for a’ that.’ Big Jim is a diamond;
an uncut diamond, I grant you, but the pure quill is
there, just the same.”</p>

<p>“Think so? By his own tell he is a spendthrift
drunkard and gambler when he has the means to buy
or bet.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of that? Does the foolish evil cancel
all the wise good? When it comes to that, how many
of us have a clean slate? I’m sure I haven’t, for
one. How about you?”</p>

<p>Philip was silent for a time, and when he spoke
again it was to say, rather complacently: “I think you
have seen the worst of me, Harry.”</p>

<p>Bromley smiled again and shook his head. “I’ve
seen the best of you, Phil. I’m only fearing the
worst.”</p>

<p>“Thanks”—curtly; “you have said something like
that before. Make it plainer.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I can; or that you’d thank me
if I could. It is merely the potentialities, I guess.”</p>

<p>“My potentialities for evil?”</p>

<p>“Both ways. You are, or you have been, virgin
ground. This gold hunt is the first thing that has ever
put the plow into you. It remains to be seen what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
kind of soil it is going to turn up. Don’t you feel that,
yourself?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why it should turn up anything
different.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t: no man has ever seen the back
of his own neck—or the close limitations of his own
rut. But the furrow is already started. You are not
the man you were when we took to the tall hills last
summer.”</p>

<p>“Better, or worse?”</p>

<p>“Let us say different. The man you are now would
never go back to school-teaching in New Hampshire.”</p>

<p>Philip nodded morosely. “I admitted that, a good
while ago, if you’ll remember. But we were talking
about Garth. What are we going to do with him after
the winter is over? Pay him his wages and tell him
to go?”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking about that. It occurs to me
that we already owe him more than wages. If you
hadn’t met him on the way out with the ponies and
brought him back with you——”</p>

<p>“I know; you couldn’t have held out alone against
the Neighbors gang very long; and if I had come back
by myself, there might have been a different story to
tell. When I made the bargain with Garth, he said
all he’d ask would be a chance to locate a claim near
ours.”</p>

<p>“Anybody who gets here first can have that.”</p>

<p>“That is what I told him. Never mind; we’ll see
about his case when spring comes. I’ll agree if you
think we ought to do something better than day-wages
for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Further talk about Garth and his deserts was halted
by the incoming of the man himself, empty-handed.</p>

<p>“No good,” was his grumbling comment on the night
deer stalking. “Reckon we don’t get us no more deer
meat this winter. I like to got bogged down myself,
gettin’ out to the water hole. There shore is one big
heap o’ snow in this neck o’ woods, if you’ll listen at
me. <i>And</i> more a-comin’.”</p>

<p>“Another storm?” said Philip.</p>

<p>“Shore as you’re a foot high. And that makes me
say what I does. I don’t like the looks o’ the way she’s
pilin’ up on the spur back o’ this wickiup of ourn.
The timber up there ain’t thick enough to hold ’er if
she gets much heavier. There’s two ways it can slide;
down to-wards the creek, ’r straight down thisaway.
Here’s hopin’.”</p>

<p>This was disturbing news. They had already seen
one slide come down on the opposite, thinly wooded
side of the gulch, and it had afforded an object-lesson
as convincing as it was startling. Garth had had hair-raising
stories to tell of prospectors’ cabins crushed
and buried under thousands of tons of snow and débris,
and their cabin site had been chosen wholly without
reference to safety from this peril.</p>

<p>“Can’t we do anything more than hope?” Philip
asked, making room for the giant before the fire.</p>

<p>“Could, maybe, if we had snow-shoes.”</p>

<p>“How?” It was Bromley who wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Shuffle up yonder and start the slide sideways with
a blast. But we ain’t got the shoes; and there ain’t
nobody goin’ to h’ist hisself up on that li’l’ hill without
’em. Yuh can bet your bottom dollar on that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>Garth’s prediction of another storm had its fulfilment
within the next few hours; and for two days
and nights the feathery burden sifted down almost
continuously, adding unmeasured depths to the already
heavy blanketing of a whitened wilderness. Trees
that had withstood the storms of many years came
crashing down under the added load, and for the first
time in the winter the three cabin dwellers were forced
to resort to melted snow for their drinking and cooking
water; it was impossible to keep the trail open to the
creek; indeed, for the two days of storm they found it
useless to try to work in the mine.</p>

<p>During the period of enforced idleness, Garth busied
himself hewing and whittling out a pair of skis, for
which the light spruce they had cut for firewood
furnished the material. Asked what he meant to do
with his footgear, he was non-committal, merely saying
that he wanted to be doing something, and that the
skis might be handy to have around if the spring
should be late in coming.</p>

<p>“We’re chawin’ a mighty big hole in the grub-stake,”
he added. “Maybe we’ll have to take to the woods, yit,
for more meat.”</p>

<p>But a starker use for the skis presented itself two
nights later, when they were all awakened by a muffled
crash that made the solidly built cabin rock as if
shaken by an earthquake shock. Garth was the first to
leap afoot and give the alarm.</p>

<p>“Grab for yer clothes and blankets and run for it!”
he shouted. “It’s the slide a-comin’ down!”</p>

<p>Struggling into their clothes in frantic haste, the
two who were the most unready to fly for their lives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
joined Garth in the small cleared area they had been
keeping open in front of the cabin. It was a bright,
moonlit night, clear, calm and deadly cold. From
the shovelled areaway they could see that the low cliff
behind the cabin had disappeared, its place being taken
by a slanting snowbank reaching up to the steep slope
of the mountain above. On the height they could
plainly see the gash left by the sliding mass that was
now filling the space between the cliff and the cabin
and heaping itself well up toward the ridge-pole on
the roof.</p>

<p>“There she is,” said Garth, pointing. “If that other
chunk lets go, it’ll be hell and repeat for the cabin!
We got to get a hump on us, mighty sudden!”</p>

<p>“But what can we do?” Philip demanded.</p>

<p>“Ain’t but one thing. That snow mount’in a-hangin’
up there over us’ll have to be eased down slaunchwise,
’r we’ll have it on top of us, shore as shootin’. Come
inside and dig out the powder and fuse whilst I’m
riggin’ for it!”</p>

<p>A handful of brush thrown into the fireplace blazed
up, illuminating the interior of the cabin fitfully. In
the firelight they could see that the rafters on the side
facing the cliff were buckling dangerously. Opening
the door communicating with the lean-to where they
stored the provisions and explosives, they found the
roof crushed in and the contents of the small room half
buried in snow. Garth had flung the deerskin over his
shoulders and was belting it about his waist. “One
of you get them skis down,” he commanded.</p>

<p>It was Philip who took the skis from their pegs on
the wall, but it was the play-boy who cut in quickly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
say: “See here, Jim; it isn’t your job to go up there
and shoot that drift! Let me have those skis.”</p>

<p>“Like hell I will!” was the brusque refusal. “Didn’t
you tell me, t’other day, that you’d never had ’em on?
Gimme that powder and fuse.”</p>

<p>“But there’s nothing like this in your contract,”
Bromley insisted.</p>

<p>“Contract be damned! You goin’ to stand there
chewin’ the rag till that drift comes down and chokes
you off? Gimme that stuff!”</p>

<p>“The dynamite will be frozen—it’s frozen now,”
said Philip.</p>

<p>“It’ll be thawed out good-and-plenty, time I get up
there,” Garth asserted, cramming the coil of fuse into
a pocket and opening his shirt to thrust the dynamite
cartridges in his armpit next the bare skin. “Open
the door and lemme out!”</p>

<p>Bitter cold as it was, they sallied out with him and
watched him as he “crabbed” over the drifts sidewise
and began the ascent on the nose of the spur. There
was nothing they could do. Until the menace of the
overhanging avalanche should be removed, it would be
a mere flirting with death to try to relieve the cabin
roof of its buckling burden. In a few minutes Garth
became a shapeless, climbing blot in the moonlight on
the bare slope, the muffling deerskin making him look
like a clumsy animal. That he could reach the critical
point, impeded as he was by the awkward foot-rigging,
seemed incredible to the anxious watchers below. Yet
without the skis to support his weight, he could have
done nothing.</p>

<p>“Th-there goes a brave man, if you’ll l-listen to me!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
stammered Bromley between his teeth chatterings.
Then: “D-did you say something a time ago about
dirty fingernails and such small matters?”</p>

<p>“<i>Don’t!</i>” exclaimed Philip sharply. And after a
breath-holding moment: “I’m a cad and a coward,
Harry. I let you try to make him turn that job over
to you a few minutes ago, and I never said a word:
I was scared crazy for fear you’d insist upon the three
of us drawing straws for it and the lot would fall to
me! That is God’s truth. Now and then I get a
glimpse of the real man inside of me, and then I know
I’m not fit to live in the same world with you and
Jim Garth.”</p>

<p>“Easy,” Bromley deprecated. “After all, if the
thing can be done, Garth is the one who can come the
nearest to pulling it off. We both know that—and he
knows it, too.”</p>

<p>The big man had climbed out of sight behind a clump
of trees, but now he reappeared higher up the slope
and not far from the impending mass that was threatening
to break down upon the cabin. They saw him
prodding in the snow with the staff he carried and
knew he was planting the dynamite.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” groaned Bromley, “why doesn’t he
get above it? If he fires it from where he is now, it
will catch him, sure!”</p>

<p>“It’s the drift; he can’t get above it—don’t you see
how it lips out over his head? Besides, it’s got to be
shot from that side. If it isn’t, it will come straight
down this way.”</p>

<p>“But, <i>Philip</i>! It’s suicide for him to shoot it from
where he is now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“It looks that way. But that’s what he is doing.
He is lighting the fuses now—don’t you see them
sputtering?”</p>

<p>Garth had risen to his feet, but now they saw him
stoop again, as if he were adjusting the fastenings of
the skis. In the brilliant moonlight they saw, or fancied
they could see, the thin, wavering curls of smoke
rising from the burning fuses. Still the big man was
crouching within arm’s-reach of the blasts he had
planted and set alight.</p>

<p>“God in heaven! Why doesn’t he get away from
there?” The words stuck in Philip’s throat and became
an almost inarticulate cry. Garth was up again and
was evidently trying to edge away along the steep snow
slope. It was plainly apparent that something had gone
wrong with one of the long, unmanageable skis. For
two or three of the edging steps he contrived to keep
it under him; then it came off and slid away down
the slope, and the two watchers saw him fall sidewise,
buried to the hip on the side that had lost its support.</p>

<p>With terrifying distinctness they saw him struggle as
a man fighting desperately for life. With one ski gone,
the other was only a shackle to hold him down.
Fiercely he strove to kick the manacling thing off,
beating frantically with his bare hands, meanwhile, at
the sputtering fuses in an effort to extinguish them
before the fire should reach the dynamite. At last he
gave over trying to free himself from the one encumbering
ski, and struggling out of the snowy pit into
which his exertions had sunk him, sought to roll aside
out of the path of the impending avalanche.</p>

<p>Given a few more precious seconds of time he might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
have made it. But the reprieve was too short. Before
he had floundered a dozen yards the snow dam holding
the huge cliff-top drift in leash leaped into the air like
a spouting geyser to the muffled cough of a triple
explosion, and an enormous white cataract poured into
the gulch a short distance valley-wards of the half-buried
cabin.</p>

<p>“Shovels!” Bromley yelped; and together the two
horrified witnesses raced up to the tunnel for digging
tools. When they ran back they had to wallow waist
deep in the yielding mass to reach the spot where the
tip of an up-ended ski marked the grave of the buried
man; and they had little hope of finding him alive as
they burrowed desperately to uncover him.</p>

<p>But Big Jim’s time to die had not yet come. When
he had found himself going, he had had the presence
of mind to draw a fold of the deerskin over his face,
holding it with a crooking arm. He was all but
asphyxiated when they dragged him out of his snowy
grave, but the fresh air soon revived him; apart from
a wrenched ankle owed to the too-well fastened ski,
he seemed to be unhurt.</p>

<p>None the less, back in the cabin and hovering over
a roaring fire in an attempt to thaw himself out, the
big man began to shake as if in an ague fit, paying the
penalty of his violent exertions in a teeth-rattling chill.
In buying the winter’s supplies in Leadville, Bromley
had included a bottle of whiskey for emergencies.
Philip searched for the bottle in the wrecked storeroom,
found it unbroken, and poured a drink for Garth.
The effect was magical. The chill subsided and Garth
begged for another drink, the single potation making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
him loose-tongued and volubly eloquent. Philip said
“no” firmly, and hid the bottle; after which, with
Bromley’s help, he got Garth out of his wet clothes
and into his bunk.</p>

<p>The giant fell asleep at once, or seemed to; and
after deciding that the buckled cabin roof would hold
until they could have daylight for its unloading, the
two who were still stirring dried themselves out before
the fire, covered the embers and went to bed. When
they awoke, the sun was shining in at the single small
window of the cabin, and Garth was still asleep, or he
appeared to be. But the empty whiskey bottle lying
on the earthen floor beside his bunk told another story.</p>

<p>“Look at that! There’s your ‘rough diamond’—dead
drunk!” Philip commented scornfully, sitting up
in his bed and pointing across to the comatose figure
in the opposite bunk. “He was only shamming after
we put him to bed last night. He waited until we were
asleep and then got up and found the liquor. I have
no use for a man who has no more self-control or
decency than that!”</p>

<p>But the play-boy was shaking his head.</p>

<p>“‘Touching the righteousness which is in the law,
blameless’,” he quoted sardonically. “That’s you,
Philip. It’s a gruesome thing to have lived such a
truly good life oneself that one can’t light a little
candle of charity for the poor sinners. I can’t forget
that Big Jim risked his life last night—and nearly lost
it—to save us from being turned out homeless and
starving in this howling desert. Let’s get a bite to eat
and unload this roof while he’s sleeping it off.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">X</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the threat of the snow slides definitely removed,
the routine of ore-digging was resumed.
Deeper and deeper the tunnel was driven into the
mountain, and each day saw the accumulation of ore
and broken rock on the dump grow in proportion.
Nothing was said by any one of the three about Garth’s
night raid on the whiskey bottle; but Philip’s attitude
toward the big miner was stiffer for the lapse—as
Bromley’s was gentler. Since there was no more liquor
in the stores, there were no more lapses; and no fault
could be found with the way Garth spent himself in
the drilling and shovelling, the ore-carrying and
sorting.</p>

<p>After a fortnight of bright sunshine in January,
with a thaw that merely compacted the surface of the
great snow blanket without perceptibly thinning it,
the cold weather came again; there were night temperatures
that made the green logs of the cabin walls crack
and snap with sounds like pistol shots, and the clay
chinkings became broad lines of hoar frost—this
though the fire on the hearth was never allowed to die
down. With an ample supply of fuel they suffered
little from the cold; but by the middle of February
the provisions were running very low. Bromley’s turn
at the cooking came in the final week of the month, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
it was he who found the bottom of their last sack of
potatoes.</p>

<p>“We can kiss the dear old Murphys good-by with
this supper,” he announced cheerfully, as he shook up
and salted the last boiling in the pot; adding: “And
everything else in the chuck-hole is going the same
way,” Then to Garth: “You know a lot more about
these mountain winters than we do, Jim. How long is
it going to be before we can break trail for Leadville?”</p>

<p>“Wish I knowed,” was the sober answer. “Two
year ago it was the last o’ May afore you could get
over the range on most o’ the trails.”</p>

<p>Bromley gave a low whistle. “Two months, and
more, of this? In less than half that time we’ll be
licking the skillet.”</p>

<p>Philip helped himself sparingly to the potatoes.
“That means short rations,” he thrust in morosely.
“We ought to have had sense enough to begin limiting
ourselves long ago. Half quantities, from this time
on, Harry.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, the rationing was begun with the next
meal, and thereupon a grim battle with a foe hitherto
unconfronted dragged its steadily weakening length
through the days and weeks. Day after day they
toiled doggedly in the tunnel, and night after night
turned in hungry after the long hours of hard work.
As the hunger grew upon them they fell silent; hours
would pass without the exchange of a word; and a
gloom, which was not to be dispelled even by Bromley’s
gallant attempts at cheerfulness, settled down upon
them.</p>

<p>It was in this famine time that the dour malady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
known as cabin madness began to show its grisly head;
the sickness that seizes upon cabin dwellers shut in
with one another and shut off from other human contacts.
As his ancestry and rearing would postulate,
Philip was the first to fall a victim to the splenetic
mania, developing an increasing irritability, with Garth
for its principal target. As the hunger pangs grew
sharper, Bromley could see that the giant’s rough
good nature was slowly breaking down under Philip’s
harsh girdings; that a time was approaching in which
surly bickerings would flare into open antagonism and
violence; and he did his best to stave off the evil day.</p>

<p>Unhappily, his best was not good enough. The
volcanic outburst came one evening while they were
eating their scanty supper. Garth, who had dug his
home-made skis out of the slide, had climbed to the
slope above the mine to make sure that the tunnel
portal and ore piles were not menaced by another
avalanche. While he was about it, Philip, coming out
of the mine to sharpen drills at the forge, had seen
Garth working his way cautiously along the upper
slope of the spur. At supper he flatly accused the
mountain man of making an examination of the slide
menace an excuse for staking off a claim of his own
which would intersect the “Little Jean” at a certain
depth in the hill.</p>

<p>“I’ve been keeping an eye on you!” he wound up
harshly. “You may think because we’re tenderfoots
we can’t see through a millstone when there’s a hole
in it, but if you do, you’re missing it a thousand miles!”</p>

<p>“<i>Philip!</i> You don’t know what you’re saying!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Bromley interposed quickly. “Jim’s all right. Why,
good Lord!——”</p>

<p>“You keep out of it!” Philip snapped back angrily.
“You may be blind but by God, I’m not!”</p>

<p>The big man was frowning sourly at his accuser.</p>

<p>“Say,” he growled in slow belligerence, “I been
thinkin’, for quite a li’l’ spell, that the time was a-comin’
when I’d have to take yuh over my knee and
larrup yuh a few. I reckon you’ve fetched it, now.
You’re the first livin’ live man that ever told Big Jim
Garth to his face that he wasn’t on the square; and
when you say it, you’re a liar!”</p>

<p>Like a bolt from a crossbow, Philip hurled himself
upon Garth, clearing the hewn slab that served as a
table at a bound. The attack was so sudden that the
big man was toppled off the block of wood upon which
he was sitting, and the two went down in a fierce
clinch. Bromley sprang up and strove to separate
the combatants as they rolled over and over upon the
earth floor, striking and clutching madly at each other.
But the half-rations upon which they had all been
starving for weeks proved the better, or at least the
more effectual, peacemaker. Breathless exhaustion
came speedily to both men to make the frenzied struggle
degenerate into a mere beating of the air; and when
a sullen peace had been patched up through Bromley’s
urgings, Philip staggered outdoors to hold a handful
of snow to an eye that had stopped a blow from Garth’s
fist in the brief battle.</p>

<p>The aftermath of this savage flare-up marked an
abysmal difference in the characteristics of the two
men; rather, perhaps, it served to mark the distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Philip had come on the road to moral disintegration.
Having fought it out with his accuser in some sort,
the rough frontiersman was willing to let bygones be
bygones; and he tried patiently, in a blundering way,
to make this plain. But Philip held stubbornly aloof.
With the cabin madness still souring in his veins he
had less and less to say to either of his fellow sufferers,
and his attitude toward Garth continued to be suspiciously
hostile.</p>

<p>It was in the latter part of April, when the snow
blanket had begun to shrink visibly under the rays of
the mounting sun, and the creek in the valley had
burst its icy bonds and was running bank full, that
they came to the famine end of things. A fortnight
earlier even the short working shifts in the mine to
which weakness had reduced them had been discontinued,
and for days Garth, slipping and sliding on his
home-made skis had been going forth with his rifle
in search of food, only to return at night empty-handed
and with the same growling lament.</p>

<p>“I’m jist so razzle-dazzled an’ no-account I ain’t
fittin’ to do nothin’ no more! They’s deer a-plenty in
these here mount’ins—I see ’em every day; but I
can’t see to shoot straight; never will get one less’n it
lets me come close enough to grab it by the neck and
choke it to death!”</p>

<p>With the beginning of the last week in April the
losing battle with hunger had become a grim waiting
game, with their final reserves of endurance pitted
against the chance of the weather. If the thawing
weather should continue, if there should be no more
storms, a few more days might make foot travel over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
the passes possible. But even so, the forty miles of
snowy wilderness to be traversed loomed dismayingly.
Could they, in their weakened condition, fight their
way out over the slippery trails? It was an open
question, and one which Philip, in whom the cabin
madness had now reached the stage of hopeless dejection,
answered in a gloomy negative.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of talking that way, Harry?” he
raged weakly—this on a day when Garth had once
more gone out to waste powder and lead. “You know
well enough we couldn’t make five miles a day in the
condition we’re in now.” Then, with a jeering laugh:
“This is the end of it.... With gold enough up
there on the dump to sink a ship, we’re starving to
death. With a world full of food only thirty or forty
miles away, we can’t buy enough to keep us alive until
the snows go.”</p>

<p>But Bromley, cheerful to the last, refused to be
daunted. “While there’s life, there’s hope,” he insisted.
“The snow is melting fast now.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make any difference to us how fast it
melts; you and I will never leave this gulch alive,
Harry. As I’ve said, neither one of us could tramp
five miles in a day, even over a level trail. It’s the
end.”</p>

<p>“You say ‘you and I’. Big Jim doesn’t complain
much, but he is as badly off as either of us.”</p>

<p>Philip, propped in his bunk, rocked his head on the
blanket pillow.</p>

<p>“I don’t trust Garth,” he muttered. “One of these
days, when he is sure we’re too nearly dead to try to
trail him, he’ll go and we’ll never see him again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“Oh, give us a rest!” snapped Bromley, losing, for
once in a way, the cheerful equanimity which had enabled
him to grapple sanely, thus far, with the hardships
and deprivations, “I wouldn’t have your narrow
angle on humanity for all the gold there is in the
‘Little Jean’! Why, good Lord, man!—Jim has been
loyalty itself, from start to finish! You’ve simply got
a crooked convolution in your brain, Philip!”</p>

<p>“Call it what you like; he’ll go, just the same. You’ll
see. And after he’s given us time to die properly,
he’ll come back and take over the mine.”</p>

<p>Bromley gave it up and crept from his bunk to the
hearth to get a light for his pipe, tobacco being the
only provision supply that was not completely exhausted.
As the day wore away, the echo of distant
rifle shots penetrated to the cabin interior from time
to time, but the sounds meant nothing more to them
than that Garth was trying again, as he had heretofore,
to kill something for the pot; trying and failing, as
a matter of course.</p>

<p>The sun had gone down and a cloudy twilight was
filling the gulch with shadows when Garth returned,
dragging the hind quarters of a deer after him.
Gaunt, bush-bearded and long-haired, the giant was
by this time a mere bony framework of a man; and
as he sank down upon his bunk he was gasping for
breath and whimpering like a hurt child.</p>

<p>“I got a doe, after the longest,” he choked; “an’
then I had to go an’ leave most o’ the meat for the
coyotes and buzzards—durn ’em—’cause I couldn’t
tote it home! Time was when I could’ve took that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
li’l’ doe across my shoulders and brought her in whole;
but I ain’t no damn’ good no more whatsoever!”</p>

<p>Bromley stumbled hastily out of his bunk.</p>

<p>“What’s that?—no good, did you say? By Jove,
you’ve saved our lives, just the same, old-timer!
Don’t you worry a minute about what you had to leave
for the dogs and birds; half a deer is better than no
meat. You just stretch yourself out and rest your
face and hands—and you, too, Phil. I’ll call you both
when supper’s ready.”</p>

<p>For the first time in many days they had a full meal
for supper, and under the stimulus of a couple of juicy
venison steaks, hot from the broiling twig, even Philip
came out of his shell of hopelessness and joined in the
discussion of the ways and means of escape. It was
Garth who set the hopeful pace.</p>

<p>“With a couple o’ days feedin’ up, I believe we can
try it,” he ventured. “Snow’s deep yit, but it’s thawin’
days and freezin’ nights so ’t there’s a crust early
mornin’s that’ll hold a man. Weather’s the only thing
I’m afeard of.”</p>

<p>“Oh, good Lord!” Bromley groaned. “Don’t tell
us there’s more snow coming!”</p>

<p>The giant wagged his beard. “Looks mighty like
it, over on the western ranges. And the sun come up
fire-red this mornin’. If it’ll only hold off for a day ’r
so, till we get a li’l’ stren’th in our bones....”</p>

<p>But the next morning when they turned out, the
storm had come, silently and as a thief in the night;
there was half a foot of fresh snow in their tiny
dooryard, and the feathery flakes were still sifting
down endlessly from gray skies with no signs of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
break in them. After breakfast, Philip went back to
his bunk and turned his face to the wall, leaving
Bromley and Garth to wash the dishes and shovel the
snow out of the small areaway.</p>

<p>“Winter’s been sort o’ hard on that pardner o’
yourn,” Garth remarked, stopping to beat the snow
from his battered hat. “Looks like he’d sort o’ lost
his sand lately.”</p>

<p>“We’re both tenderfoots, you must remember,” said
the loyal play-boy. “It’s all new to both of us, Jim.
But Phil will come out all right.” Then: “What is
this fresh snow storm going to do to us?”</p>

<p>“Depends on how long it’s goin’ to keep up. There’s
enough now to block the trails for another week ’r
so. I was afeard it was comin’.”</p>

<p>“Well, we have meat enough to last for a while,
anyhow,” Bromley put in hopefully. “And that’s
thanks to you, Jim. We won’t say die till we’re dead.”</p>

<p>All through the day the gray skies held their own
and the snow sifted down as though it would never
stop. By nightfall the six inches of new blanketing
had grown to a foot, and the prospect of escape had
withdrawn into a remote distance. When Bromley
raked the coals out and made ready to broil the supper
steaks, he was the only one of the three who preserved
even a semblance of cheerfulness. Philip was cursing
the weather bitterly; and Garth, stretched out in his
bunk with a cold pipe clamped between his teeth, was
scarcely more companionable.</p>

<p>It was while the venison was sizzling over the
coals that Bromley cocked an ear and said: “Listen!”
Into the silence thus commanded came the muffled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
hoofbeats of a horse and then a shout of “Hello, the
cabin!” from without. Garth sprang up to unbar the
door, and Philip reached for a rifle, gasping out,
“It’s Neighbors again!”</p>

<p>But the stocky figure that appeared in the doorway
was not that of the leader of the jumpers; it was a
far more welcome apparition—the figure of the man
who, up to that time, had bought, sold and operated
more mines than any other promoter in Colorado—Stephen
Drew.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” he said, coming in to shake the snow
from his poncho and to stamp it from his feet, “I
thought I’d find you somewhere up in this gulch!
Found out what old winter can do to you in the
Rockies, haven’t you?” and he shook hands with the
exiles, and not less heartily with Garth than with the
two younger men, saying: “You here, too, Jim? If
I had known that, I wouldn’t have been quite so anxious
about these two young tenderfoots.”</p>

<p>Philip sat down on his bunk and he was gasping
again.</p>

<p>“Are—are the trails open, Mr. Drew?” he stammered.</p>

<p>“They were day before yesterday, when we crossed
the main range, but they will be blocked again for a
few days, now. However, that doesn’t matter. I
knew you must be running short of supplies, so I
brought a pack train along. I left the outfit making
camp in the valley below and rode on ahead to see
if I could locate you.”</p>

<p>Bromley laughed happily.</p>

<p>“You look like an angel out of heaven to us, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
Drew,” he bubbled. “We’d eaten the last of our grub-stake
and were starving when Jim killed a deer and
saved our lives. How did you find the way in?”</p>

<p>The promoter planted himself comfortably upon
Garth’s bunk, and he was smiling genially when he
said: “We had to use a little diplomacy. One of the
Neighbors gang took one drink too many and spilled
the beans. We got hold of him and gave him his
choice between going to jail and coming along with
us as a guide. He’s with the outfit now. But tell
me—have you got a mine to show me?”</p>

<p>It was Garth who got in the first word about the
“Little Jean.”</p>

<p>“You’re shoutin’,” he said. “These boys’ve got a
li’l’ bonanza, right! There’s enough rich, free-millin’
ore on the dump to run you crazy. We’re in a good
piece on the vein, and she’s a-holdin’ up like a lady.
All these boys is a-needin’ now is somebody to back
’em with a li’l’ capital, and——”</p>

<p>“Easy, Jim,” laughed the promoter; “I know the
color of your paints. But never mind,”—this to Philip
and Bromley. “If you’ve got something that measures
half-way up to those assays you had made last fall,
I’m ready to talk turkey with you. But we’ll have to
talk fast and work fast—if we want to protect ourselves.
The rush for the new diggings isn’t more
than a day’s march behind us on the trail we’ve broken
over the range, and when it comes, we’ll be swamped.
Jim, you old mossback, see if you can’t carve a couple
more steaks off that deer bone and broil them for me.
I’m as hungry as a hunter.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> it was now well into the summer edge of
spring for the lower altitudes, a late snow had fallen
during the night, and the Continental Divide, framed
in the window where Philip was sitting, was clothed
in virgin white. In the street below, the snow had
already been trampled into a grimy batter by the hoofs
and wheels of laboring streams of traffic. Philip
looked down upon the busy street scene, trying vainly
to realize that this teeming, throbbing, palpitant mining-camp
city of thirty-five or forty thousand souls was less
than three years old; that, only three backward turnings
of the calendar in the past, the marvelous treasure
beds in its swelling hills were barely getting themselves
discovered.</p>

<p>From such contemplation of the material marvel
his thoughts turned inward. For the better part of
a year, and with only the brief autumn visit to the
great wonder camp to break the wilderness monotonies,
he had been an exile with all the familiar human contacts
dissevered; it had been a period during which,
for him and Bromley, the moving world had ceased
to exist. He was just now beginning to apprehend
the complete totality of the time eclipse. In the lost
interval an exciting national political campaign had
run its course, Garfield had been elected president, and
his inauguration had taken place; all this without disturbing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
by so much as the turning of a leaf, the
cosmic procession of the weeks and months in the
mountain fastnesses, or recording itself in any way
upon the pages of great Nature’s book of the unpeopled
immensities.</p>

<p>In the more intimate and personal relations there
had been a corresponding break. Never more than a
desultory letter-writer, he had sent a card to his mother
and sisters in New Hampshire on the occasion of his
former trip to Leadville, telling them not to write
again until they should hear from him—that he expected
to be out of reach of the mails for the duration
of the winter. Hence, there had been no home letters
awaiting him when he emerged from the western wilderness;
nothing to help bridge the separating chasm of
the months.</p>

<p>In the few days that had elapsed since his return
to Leadville he had been making determined but futile
efforts to close the gap; to regard the year of exile
as an incident, and to take up the normal thread of
life where he had dropped it the preceding spring.
The discovery that this could not be done—that the
change from flannel shirt, corduroys and miner’s boots
to civilized clothes, and from a log cabin in the wilds
to a comfortable hotel in the great mining-camp,
wrought no miracle of readjustment—was confusing.
Was the curious inner consciousness of a changed
point of view merely a step forward in character
development? Or had the step been taken in the opposite
direction—into the region of things primitive
and baldly disillusioning? He could not tell; and the
inability to make the distinction was strangely disturbing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
When the attempt to account for his present
mental attitude became a fatiguing strain, he twisted
his chair from the window to make it face the scene
in the handsomely furnished business office.</p>

<p>At a table in the middle of the room, Bromley,
garmented as a gentleman of leisure and wearing his
good clothes with an easy and accustomed grace that
Philip envied, was talking in low tones with a stockily
built man whose dark eyes, heavy brows and aquiline
nose gave his features a Jewish cast. Half absently
Philip, compared the two faces: Bromley’s high-bred,
animated, impishly youthful; Stephen Drew’s strong,
kindly—the face of a man whose generous dealings
with his friends and business associates had given him
a notability as marked as that of the lavish spenders
who were making the name of the Colorado “lucky-strike”
miner a synonym for all that was fantastic and
extravagant.</p>

<p>The moment, as Philip tried, rather ineffectually, to
realize, was epochal. Drew and his party of experts
had spent a fortnight at the “Little Jean,” exploring,
testing, estimating the probable extent of the ore body
and preparing samples for additional assays. And now,
as the net result, at the farther end of the business
office Drew’s attorney was dictating to a young clerk
whose pen was flying rapidly over the pages of legal
cap paper—using the pen, though one of the new
writing machines lately come into use stood on its
iron-legged table within easy reach.</p>

<p>After a time the lawyer came to the table in the
middle of the room with the finished document in his
hands and ran through its provisions with his client<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
and Bromley. Drew nodded and dipped a pen, looking
up to say to Philip: “All right, Mr. Trask; if
you’ll come and look this over——”</p>

<p>Philip dragged his chair to the table and read the
paper Drew passed to him. It was an agreement defining
the duties, responsibilities, undertakings and emoluments
of the three principals in the “Little Jean”;
namely, the two discoverers and the man who was
furnishing the working capital; and its provisions were
simple and straightforward. On his part the promoter
undertook to develop the mine, paying an equitable
royalty to the discoverers, the royalty provision including
a liberal cash advance.</p>

<p>“I think that is about as we talked,” Drew said. “If
you and Mr. Bromley are agreeable, we may as well
sign up and call it a deal.”</p>

<p>With a hand that shook a little in spite of his best
effort to hold it steady, Philip signed and passed the
papers and pen to Bromley.</p>

<p>“Wigglesworth?” the promoter queried, when the
papers came back to him with Bromley’s signature.
“Is that a family name?”</p>

<p>“Very much so,” admitted the play-boy, with a grin.</p>

<p>“I used to know some Wigglesworths in Philadelphia.
Relations of yours?”</p>

<p>“They are, indeed. My mother was a Wigglesworth.”</p>

<p>Stephen Drew signed as lessee of the “Little Jean”
with the intricate pen flourish familiar to every bank
teller in Leadville and Denver, and the young clerk
attested the signatures as notary. The formalities
concluded, Drew spoke of the practical details.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“We’ll go in as soon as we can get in with the
machinery for a mill. We’ll have to have our own
mill, of course. Freighting the machinery over the
range will be a costly job, but there is no way to avoid
it. Rich as the ore is, it wouldn’t pay to jack freight
it out over the mountains. However, you have ore
enough on the dump to take care of the overhead.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that we don’t owe you an apology
for not discovering our mine in some place nearer the
broad highways,” Bromley put in whimsically. “It is
due to us to say that we did try, pretty faithfully, to
do that very thing, before we crossed over to the
Western slope, but we couldn’t make it.”</p>

<p>Drew smiled. “Any old miner will tell you that
the gold is where you find it, and not anywhere else.
Fortunately for all of us, the ‘Little Jean’ is rich
enough to warrant the building of a small mill, even at
the high cost of taking the machinery over the range
piecemeal—rich enough and with an ore body large
enough. But I take it you two are not very pointedly
interested in the operating details, so long as the dividends
are forthcoming. Have you made any plans for
the summer?—for yourselves, I mean?”</p>

<p>Philip denied for himself.</p>

<p>“I think we have been merely living from day to day
for the past few weeks. I haven’t any plans reaching
beyond Denver, at present. And you haven’t, either,
have you, Harry?”</p>

<p>Bromley shook his head. “Not the ghost of a plan.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said the promoter; “then we can keep in
touch, more or less, during the make-ready. I am
back and forth between the mountains and Denver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
every week or so. Now if you will come around to the
bank with me, I’ll deposit those cash advances to your
credit and you’ll be footloose to do as you please.”</p>

<p>The bank visited, and arrangements made for the
transfer of the better part of their fortune-earnest to
a bank in Denver, the two who, a few months before,
had been merely marching privates in the eager army
of prospectors, shook hands with their lessee and fared
forth into the streets of Leadville as men of solid
substance.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Bromley, after they had walked in
silence for something more than half the distance from
the bank to their hotel—which, it is needless to say,
was not the second-rate tavern at which they had put
up on the occasion of their former visit.</p>

<p>“Say it,” Philip invited.</p>

<p>“I was just wondering where you were ‘at’; whether
you were here in the flesh, or a thousand miles away in
the spirit.”</p>

<p>“I am trying to get my feet on the ground,” was the
sober answer.</p>

<p>“Still seems like a pipe-dream, does it?”</p>

<p>“More than ever.”</p>

<p>Bromley laughed. “A little chunk of solitude is
what you need—time off in which to get used to it.
Here is our bunk house. Capture a quiet corner in the
lobby, if you can find one, light your pipe and have it
out with yourself. I’m going to do a bit of shopping;
buy me a bag and a few more articles of glad raiment.”</p>

<p>Philip halted on the hotel steps to frown down upon
his late camp-mate.</p>

<p>“You’ve been your own man for nearly a full year,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
Harry. Don’t go and lie down now and roll your pack
off like a fool jackass.”</p>

<p>This time Bromley’s laugh was a shout.</p>

<p>“So the good old New England conscience comes up
smiling, after all, does it?” he chuckled. “Give it a
pat on the back and tell it to go to sleep again, so far
as I am concerned. I’m merely going to buy a bag and
something to put in it, and I’ll promise you to come
back sober as a judge. Want me to swear it?” and he
held up his hand.</p>

<p>“I’d hate to see you ditch yourself now,” said Philip
gravely; and with that he went in and found the quiet
corner and sat down to fill and light his pipe.</p>

<p>An hour later he was still sitting in the corner of
the writing-room alcove, with the cold pipe between
his teeth, as oblivious of his surroundings as if he had
been alone on a desert island. Realization was slowly
coming. He was no longer a striving unit in the vast
army of day-to-day bread-winners. Wealth, to which
all things must bow and pay tribute, was his. Twice,
and yet once again, he found himself taking the crisp
bit of bank paper from his pocket to stare at it, to pass
it through his fingers so that he might hear the reassuring
crackle of it. To the possessor of that slip of
paper, and of the treasure store of which it was assumptively
only an infinitesimal fraction, all things
humanly possible were as good as facts accomplished.</p>

<p>What to do with all this wealth? For an illuminating
instant he was able to appreciate the embarrassment
of those other lucky ones who, from having nothing
but eager hopes, found themselves suddenly in possession
of more money than they knew how to dispense.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
Desires, legitimate or the other kind, do not come into
being in the turning of a leaf. They must have time
in which to germinate and burgeon. Philip saw how
easy it would be for the spendthrifts of luck to give
free rein to the impulses of the moment, however
grotesque or extravagant; more, for a passing breath
he was conscious of the unfathered birth in himself of
just such impulses. But the traditions quickly asserted
their supremacy. It was not to breed a prodigal that
his Trask and Sanborn forebears had dug a frugal
living out of the reluctant New England soil. Whatever
else might happen, there should be none of the
antics of the mad and extravagant wasters.</p>

<p>It was thus that Bromley found him at the early
dinner hour; still isolated in the quiet corner, and still
with the long-since-extinguished pipe clamped between
his teeth.</p>

<p>“Back again, are you, Harry?” he said, hoisting himself
with an effort out of the deep gulf of the reveries.</p>

<p>“Same day; same afternoon. And I’ve made a discovery.
The railroads, two of them, have been creeping
up since we were here before. There are night
trains. What do you say to ordering an early dinner
and shaking the slush of this metropolis from our
muddy feet?”</p>

<p>“It suits me perfectly. There are sleeping-cars?”</p>

<p>“There are; and I have engaged a couple of berths.
I’m beginning to long for the flesh-pots; otherwise the
comforts of a not-too-crowded Denver hotel. Shall
we go and eat a pasty or so and gird ourselves for the
flitting? Or has the piece of money paper you got a
while back killed your appetite?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>Philip did not reply until they were entering the
dining-room together. Then he said, quite as if there
had been no interval between question and answer:
“It runs in my mind that money breeds many more
appetites than it kills. You ought to paste that saying
in your hat, Harry.”</p>

<p>“I?” laughed the play-boy. “What about yourself?”</p>

<p>“I told you once that I hadn’t come to Colorado to
make a fool of myself.”</p>

<p>Bromley laughed again.</p>

<p>“If all mankind were only as virtuous and impeccable
as you think you are, Philip, what a Paradise
we’d be living in! Let’s take that table for two over
in the alcove; then we won’t have to mix and mingle
with the plebeian crowd and run the risk of having
some of the virtues rubbed off of us.”</p>

<p>The dinner which was presently served was too
appetizing to encourage any more than desultory conversation,
and it was not until after the black coffee
had been brought in that Bromley said: “By the way,
I wonder what has become of Big Jim?”</p>

<p>Philip looked up with a small frown creasing itself
between his eyes.</p>

<p>“Garth? I haven’t seen him since the night after we
reached town. He is somewhere in the dives, blowing
his winter’s wages, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Bromley’s eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>“And you don’t care a whoop. Is that the part of
it you left unsaid?”</p>

<p>Philip’s answer was indirect, but none the less
explicit.</p>

<p>“I haven’t much use for a man who begins to wallow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
as soon as he comes to the first available mud-puddle;
and you know that is what Garth did. He was tanked
full before we’d been six hours in Leadville.”</p>

<p>Bromley looked away and was silent for a time.
When he spoke again it was to say: “It’s a convenient
thing to have a good, workable forgettery, Phil. For
my part, you know, I can’t help fancying that we
wouldn’t be here sipping this excellent black coffee
to-night if Jim Garth were taken out of the picture.
However, that is probably only one of my foolish
hallucinations. I’m subject to them at times. If you
are quite through, suppose we call it a day and see if
we can’t charter a hack to take us to the railroad.
The Denver train is due to leave in less than half an
hour; both of them, in fact—one over each of the
two roads.”</p>

<p>“Which one do we take?” Philip asked, rising and
feeling for his pipe.</p>

<p>“The one whose brass collar you were wearing a
year ago,” said Bromley with a grin.</p>

<p>Philip took out his pocketbook and extracted from
it the return portion of an employee’s pass issued to
him nearly a year before, the “going” part of which
he had used to the end of track at the beginning of
the prospecting trip; and New England thrift was
seated firmly in the saddle when he said: “Pshaw!
why didn’t I think of it! I might have got this renewed
and so saved my fare to Denver!”</p>

<p>Harry Bromley’s laugh made the other diners look
around to see what was happening.</p>

<p>“What a pity you didn’t think of it!” he chuckled.
“All that good money that I paid for your ticket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
wasted—thrown away—tossed to the dogs! And you
with no resources whatever excepting the undivided
half of a bonanza gold mine. Come on; let’s remove
ourselves from the scene of such a crushing discovery.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let up!” said Philip sourly; but as they were
leaving the dining-room together he put the worn piece
of a free pass carefully back into his pocketbook.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Denver to which Philip and Harry Bromley
returned, after their year in the mountain half of
Colorado, had undergone many changes in the twelve-month;
was still undergoing them. Developing under
the double stimulus of the unabated rush of treasure—and
health-seekers from the East and the marvelous
and increasing flow of wealth from the mines, the city
was growing like a juggler’s rose. In the business
district the one- and two-storied makeshifts of pioneer
days were rapidly giving place to statelier structures;
a handsome railroad passenger terminal had been completed
at the foot of Seventeenth Street; horse-car lines
were extending in all directions; new hotels had sprung
up; and the theater which was to rival in magnificence,
if not in actual size, the Paris Opéra, was under construction.</p>

<p>Unlike that of other western communities owing
their prosperity to a mining boom, the city’s growth
was notably substantial. With eastern and Pacific
Coast lumber at a high freight rate premium, brick
and the easily worked lava stone of the hogbacks were
the chosen building materials. In the outlying residence
districts the empty squares were filling with rows of
brick cottages absurdly restricted in width by the limitations
of the standard twenty-five-foot lots, but making
up for the lack of breadth in slender length; and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
streets besides Larimer were acquiring massive steel
bridges over the bisecting Cherry Creek which, from
being a mere moist sand bed in most seasons of the
year, could—and did upon occasion—become a raging
cloud-burst torrent, sweeping all before it.</p>

<p>After quarters had been secured in the new St.
James Hotel in Curtis Street, Philip left Bromley
reading the morning papers in the lobby and went
around to the building in Lawrence Street where he
had served his brief apprenticeship in the auditor’s
office of the narrow-gauge railroad. Here he learned
that the mountain road had been absorbed by the
Union Pacific, that its office force had been scattered,
but that Middleton, his former desk-mate, could be
found at the car-record desk in the Union Station.
When he walked in upon the former tonnage clerk
a little later, Middleton’s greeting was salted with a
bantering grin.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well; so the cat came back, did it? No,
wait—let me say it: you’ve had your fill of the tall
hills and want a railroad job again. Do I call the
turn?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” Philip returned, seating himself at
the desk end. “I have looked you up to see if, by any
chance, you have any mail for me.”</p>

<p>“Sure! There’s a bunch of it. You didn’t seem to
think it worth your while to send in any forwarding
address, so we’ve been holding your letters on the
chance that you’d turn up sometime and somewhere.
Wait a minute and I’ll go get ’em for you.”</p>

<p>When the packet of mail came, Philip went through
it leisurely. Most of the letters were from his sisters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
in New Hampshire, the later ones reminding him rather
acidly that a correspondence was ordinarily supposed
to be two-sided. These, and two or three from former
classmates and friends, made up the accumulation.</p>

<p>“There was nothing else?” he asked, with a shade of
disappointment.</p>

<p>“That’s the crop, I believe. Ought there to be
more?”</p>

<p>“One more, at least.”</p>

<p>“Let me think,” said Middleton. “I believe all your
mail was brought to me while we were in the old
Lawrence Street office. I kept the letters in my desk
for a long time, but after the consolidation I turned
them over to Baldwin in the superintendent’s office,
thinking I might not be here when you sent or came
for them.” As he spoke, he opened a drawer and
rummaged in it, saying: “They were stacked here in
this corner, and ... why, yes; here <i>is</i> another. Don’t
see how I came to miss it.”</p>

<p>Philip glanced at the envelope of the newly found
letter. It bore the Denver postmark, and the date was
barely two weeks later than that upon which the prospecting
trip had been begun. The enclosure was merely
a note, but it was easy to read the heartbreak between
the lines.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear Mr. Trask:</p>

<p>The Captain left us three days ago. We waited too long
before bringing him here. I am writing because you asked
me to, though I don’t know whether or not this will find you.
The end came very suddenly at the last; but you will be glad
to know that it was peaceful—that there wasn’t unbearable
suffering.</p>

<p>I don’t know yet what we shall do, or where we shall go;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
or if, indeed, we shall go anywhere. There is nothing to go
back to Mississippi for, even if we could afford it; and there
ought to be something for us—or for me—to do here in
Denver. I shall try to find something, anyway.</p>

<p>Mother wishes to be kindly remembered to you, and so do
the children. You were friendly to us at a time when we
needed friendship; and, as I once told you, we do not forget.</p>

<p class="right">Sincerely and sorrowfully,<br>
Jean Dabney. &#160; &#160;</p>
</div>

<p>Philip returned the letter to its envelope and put it in
his pocket.</p>

<p>“Bad news?” Middleton asked.</p>

<p>Philip was of no mind to share personal confidences
with his former desk-mate. “Sad for the writer,” he
replied. “It is a note telling of the death of a poor
consumptive who was on the train with me coming out
from Kansas City last spring.”</p>

<p>This casual explanation side-tracked the matter, as
he hoped it might; and Middleton went on to say:
“So you haven’t come to look for a job? Perhaps you
have a better one. You seem to be wearing pretty
good clothes.”</p>

<p>“The clothes are paid for,” said Philip with a close-lipped
smile; and then, the reticent traditions taking
a fresh hold: “I have a fairly good job at present,
keeping personal books for a fellow who owns a half-interest
in a mine over on the other side of the Divide.”</p>

<p>“Pay better than the railroad?”</p>

<p>“M-m—some better; yes.”</p>

<p>“Had your pick-and-shovel summer for nothing, of
course, like hundreds of other tenderfoots, I take it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that: I had a decently good
time and picked up some little experience. For one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
thing, I got better acquainted with the fellow whose
books I am keeping.”</p>

<p>“You knew him before you went prospecting?”</p>

<p>“Slightly; yes.”</p>

<p>“Is he here in Denver now?”</p>

<p>Philip smiled again. “If he weren’t here, I shouldn’t
be here.” Then: “Anything new with you? Haven’t
made that marrying trip to Ohio yet, have you?”</p>

<p>The fat-faced ex-tonnage clerk shook his head and
looked as if Philip’s question were more or less embarrassing.</p>

<p>“No; not yet.”</p>

<p>Philip got up to go. “Much obliged to you for
keeping my letters for me. If any more should come
before I can let people know where to reach me, just
have the carrier bring them around to the St James.”</p>

<p>“Oho!” said Middleton, with his nickering laugh;
“so we live in a first-class hotel now, do we?”</p>

<p>“We do,” Philip admitted; and with that he took
his leave.</p>

<p>Though he had carried it off casually for Middleton’s
benefit, the reading of Jean Dabney’s pathetic
little note had moved him profoundly, and he was disappointed
at not finding some later word from her,
telling what course had been decided upon, and giving
an address by means of which he might communicate
with her. Was the family still in Denver? And, if so,
how was it contriving to live? He had seen genteel
poverty at home at sufficiently short range to be able
to recognize the signs of it, and he wondered how
much, if anything, had been left for the widow and her
three girls after the funeral expenses had been paid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>Then, too, Jean’s intimation that she would try to
find work in Denver stirred a deep pool of compassion
in him. With the northern man’s preconception of
southern women it was difficult to envisage her as the
bread-winner for a family of four; but that it must
have come to this in the end he was fairly well assured.
His single contact with the Mississippi family as a
whole had given him the impression that the mother
was devoted but not particularly resourceful in any
practical way; “do-less” would be the harsh New England
word, but with a feeling that large allowances
should be made for any woman who had grown up in
the slave-served South, he did not apply it.</p>

<p>Eliminating the mother as a possible earner, the
burden must have fallen upon the eldest daughter, and
he tried to picture Jean looking for work in a city
which was already boasting that it had a population
of over thirty thousand young men in addition to its
familied quota. There must have been difficulties insurmountable.
Places ordinarily given to women in
the East were almost exclusively filled by men in the
Denver of the moment, even to clerkships at the ribbon
counters. “Good Lord!” he exclaimed, suddenly realizing
that nearly a year had elapsed since the writing
of the sorrowful little death notice. “Why, all four of
them may have starved to death long before this!”</p>

<p>What to do about it was the burning question, and
he went about the doing promptly, first writing a note
and addressing it to “Miss Jean Dabney, General
Delivery,” and next making a pilgrimage to the tent
colony where he had found the Dabneys on the eve
of his departure for the mountains. Nothing came of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
the pilgrimage. The tents were still there, but the
people occupying them were all newcomers; a shifting
population coming and going from day to day. Nobody
knew anything of a family of two women, two
little girls and a sick man who had died.</p>

<p>Later in the day he went in search of the American
House clerk who had directed him in the former instance;
but here, again, the kaleidoscopic population-shifting
baffled him. The clerk, whom he was able to
identify in his inquiry by the date of his employment
at the hotel, had left Denver—for Pueblo, so his informant
thought; at least, that had been his mail forwarding
address for a time.</p>

<p>With the vanishing of this, the only other possible
clue he could think of, Philip spent the remainder of
the day in aimless wanderings in the streets, passing
the sidewalk throngs in review in some vague hope that
he might thus stumble upon Jean or her mother. When
the hope refused to materialize, he returned to the St.
James in time to join Bromley at dinner, and for the
first half of the meal was but a poor table-mate for
his lighthearted partner.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you, Phil? Is the rich
man’s burden crushing you this early in the game?”
Bromley inquired quizzically, after a number of fruitless
attempts to break through the barrier of abstraction
behind which his table companion had retreated.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not,” was the half-absent reply. “I
haven’t been thinking much about the money.”</p>

<p>“Well, what have you been doing with yourself
all day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“I have been looking for somebody that I couldn’t
find.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the play-boy with his teasing smile.
“The angelic person, for a guess. Am I right?”</p>

<p>“It’s no joke,” Philip returned soberly. “I found
a note from her in my mail at the railroad office. It
is nearly a year old. Her father died a few days
after we left Denver last spring.”</p>

<p>Bromley became instantly sympathetic. “And you
don’t know what has become of her?”</p>

<p>“No; I can’t find a trace.”</p>

<p>“She was left alone after her father’s death?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; there is a family—a mother and two
younger girls.”</p>

<p>“Migrants, like all the rest of us, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes; from Mississippi. They came out for the
father’s health—and came too late. He was an ex-rebel
soldier.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they have gone back to the South.”</p>

<p>Philip shook his head. “I hardly think so; I doubt
if they had the means. The war had left them poor.”</p>

<p>“Tell me more,” Bromley urged.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you much more, only I suspect the
burden of the family support has been dumped upon
the shoulders of the oldest daughter. And I don’t
know how she would be able to carry it in this man-ridden
town.”</p>

<p>“The mother?” Bromley suggested.</p>

<p>“A dear lady, I should say, from what little I saw
of her, but helpless.”</p>

<p>“I understand; a woman who has never had to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
for herself anything that black servants could do for
her.”</p>

<p>“Something of that sort,” said Philip.</p>

<p>“Tell me what you’ve done toward locating them.”</p>

<p>Philip briefed the story of the day’s efforts, and
Bromley held his peace while the waiter was clearing
the table for the dessert. But afterward he said:
“Your note may bring the required information;
but if it doesn’t, we’ve got to think up some other way.
Miss Jean and her family must be found, if they are
still in Denver.”</p>

<p>Philip looked up quickly. “How did you know her
name?” he demanded; and Bromley laughed.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you christen the ‘Little Jean’?” he asked.
“It didn’t require any great amount of clairvoyance to
figure out where the name came from. What is the
rest of it?”</p>

<p>“Dabney.”</p>

<p>“A good old Southern name; they used to be
D’Aubignys in Colonial times.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about them?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, excepting what little leaked into me out
of the history books in school: French, of course, and
Huguenots. Settled first in Virginia, I believe. But
that’s not to the point. As I say, we’ve got to find
Miss Jean.”</p>

<p>“‘We’?” Philip queried.</p>

<p>“That is what I said. Your relations with the young
woman are your own, and I’m not messing in on them.
Mine are in the nature of a debt.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t know her!” Philip protested.</p>

<p>“No more I don’t; but the debt remains. Tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
baldly, Phil: would you ever have thought of taking
me on the prospecting trip, if she hadn’t suggested it?”</p>

<p>“Since you put it that way, I might not have.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then. In that case I owe her my stake
in the game, whatever it is, or whatever it may eventually
amount to. We must find this shipwrecked
family.”</p>

<p>Philip shook his head in discouragement.</p>

<p>“If she doesn’t get my note and answer it, it will be
much like looking for a needle in a haystack. You see
what this town has grown to in a single year. Besides,
if we should find the Dabneys, I can assure you
in advance that they are not the kind of people you
can give money to.”</p>

<p>“Trust me for that part of it,” Bromley said. “There
are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it to
death with thick cream. If you are through, let’s go
out and see what this money-mad city looks like by
lamplight in the spring of a new year. I have a fairly
vivid recollection of its appearance under such conditions
a short twelve-month ago.”</p>

<p>In Philip’s acquiescence to this proposal there was
a strong thread of the brother-keeping weave, an inheritance
from a long line of ancestors who took their
Bible literally. From the ancestral point of view,
Bromley was still figuring, in Philip’s estimation, as a
brand snatched from the burning. With the means
now at his command to gratify the worst impulses of
the ne’er-do-well, could Bromley be trusted to walk
alone in the midst of temptations? Philip thought not;
feared not, at least. Therefore, the brotherly supervision
must be maintained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“Where to?” he asked, as they fared forth from the
hotel.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind; anywhere you like,” was the
careless reply. “The theater, if that jumps with your
notion.”</p>

<p>With the new opera house still figuring as an unfinished
building, the only legitimate theater was a
remodeled billiard hall in Sixteenth Street; and on this
particular evening they found it dark.</p>

<p>“That puts it up to the varieties,” said Bromley.
“Care to go down to the Corinthian?”</p>

<p>It was a measure of the distance Philip had traversed
in a year that he did not immediately negative this
proposal. He had known the Corinthian—though only
by repute—as a place sedulously to be avoided by all
self-respecting persons; a combined varieties theater,
gambling house and worse, catering only to the abandoned
of both sexes. But now an impulse which he
was calling idle curiosity made him acquiesce. Why
shouldn’t a man go to such a place at least once in a
way, if only to see for himself and thus be able to
condemn with knowledge, and not merely from hearsay?
And Bromley?—Bromley would be safe enough,
with somebody to look out for him and hold on to
him. So he said: “I don’t care—if you know the
way around in such places. I’ve never been there.”</p>

<p>Bromley laughed.</p>

<p>“It will give you a vastly better opinion of the general
run of mankind—and womankind, I imagine,” he
said half mockingly. “Come along; I’ll chaperon you.”</p>

<p>Some hours later, when Philip wound his watch and
put it under his pillow, preparatory to undressing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
going to bed, its hands were pointing to midnight.
With creeping shudders of repulsion he was telling
himself that in the time intervening between the half-hesitant
accession to Bromley’s suggestion and their
return to the hotel he had not only seen humanity at
its lowest ebb, but had also besmeared his own body
and mind with the reeking mud of the tide flats.</p>

<p>A long, narrow, shop-like room, with a tawdry stage
at one end, a seated lower floor, and a row of curtained
gallery boxes running along both sides; on the main
floor, filling the seats, a rough audience, strictly
masculine, uproariously applauding a painted woman
on the stage who was singing “Only a Pansy Blossom”:
this was what they had seen and heard upon making
their way past the bar in the Corinthian.</p>

<p>For a time they had looked on from the rear of the
lower floor, while the five-piece orchestra blared and
drummed and squeaked, and aproned waiters came
and went with liquor-bearing trays, and the air grew
foggy with tobacco smoke rising in a dim nimbus over
the booted and hatted crowd jamming the narrow room
to suffocation. There had been other numbers to
follow that of the sentimental singer, most of them
suggestive, some of them baldly obscene. Then Bromley,
with the impish grin now in permanence, had
proposed a retreat to the more select surroundings of
the gallery boxes, and they had gone up-stairs.</p>

<p>Philip, sitting on his bedside chair with one shoe
off, was telling himself, with a recurrence of the creeping
shudder, that he should never live long enough
decently to efface the degrading experience of the
next hour. They had scarcely seated themselves in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
of the boxes before a woman came in—a woman without
shame. Bromley, still grinning amiably, had
waved her aside, and had passed a friendly signal of
warning to him—Philip. But when the woman came
to perch on his knee, he did not know how to repulse
her.</p>

<p>There was still a dingy smudge of rice powder on
the breast of his waistcoat, and he flung the garment
across the room with an angry curse. For the first
time in his life he had held a wanton woman in his
arms, had talked to her, had yielded to her persuasions
and bought liquor for her. And it was small comfort
now to remember that he had refused to drink with
her when the liquor came; or that—backed by Bromley
in this—he had refused to stay until the close of her
working day and go home with her.</p>

<p>“My God!” he exclaimed, as he turned off the gas
and crept into bed to lie wide-eyed and staring in the
darkness: “My God! if I’d been alone—if Bromley
hadn’t been there to drag me out.... And all along
I’ve been calling myself a decent man and Harry’s
keeper!”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning at breakfast, with the midnight
reaction still daggering him, Philip was shamefacedly
reticent until after he found that Bromley, charitably
or otherwise, was completely ignoring the Corinthian
episode. Though he was far from being capable of
banishing it himself, he contrived to push it aside
sufficiently to enable him to carry his part in the table
talk.</p>

<p>“No, I hadn’t thought of camping down in a hotel,”
was his reply to Bromley’s question as to his plans for
the summer. “Comfortable as this place is, it isn’t
quite my idea of living: too monotonous. What I’m
thinking of is a bachelor apartment in one of the down-town
buildings, with meals wherever the eating is best;
something of that sort for the present, at least. How
about you?”</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, I haven’t been thinking much
more than a minute or so ahead,” the play-boy confessed,
with his disarming smile at its attractive best.
“This sudden cataracting of filthy lucre has a tendency
to make me lightheaded—that is, more lightheaded than
usual, which you will say is gilding the lily. I did have
some vague notion of taking a trip back home and
astonishing the natives. It would astonish them, you
know.”</p>

<p>“To see you back again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“To see me come back with money in my purse—and
more of it to follow. They’d think the world was coming
to an end. But, on second thought, I guess it
wouldn’t do. I shouldn’t care to give any of them
heart failure.”</p>

<p>“But if you don’t go home?” Philip queried.</p>

<p>“In that event your bachelor apartment idea has an
irresistible appeal. Unless you particularly long for
complete solitude, I’d be glad to join you. Say a couple
of bed-rooms, a bath and perhaps a common sitting-room?”</p>

<p>“Done,” said Philip shortly. “What next?”</p>

<p>“For me?—oh, confound your picture! You are
bound and determined to make me think more than
one day ahead, in spite of everything, aren’t you?
All right, if I must. After we are settled, perhaps
I shall look around and try to find some safe investment
niches into which I can dribble my share of the
golden showers from the ‘Little Jean’ as they come in.”</p>

<p>“Good. That is the most sensible thing I’ve heard
you say in a week of Sundays!” said the one in whom
the reaction to the New England normalities had by
this time wrought its perfect work.</p>

<p>“And the least expected, you would add—if you
were not too soft-hearted. That, too, is all right; I
wasn’t expecting it myself. Nothing has ever been
farther from my promptings heretofore, I can solemnly
assure you.”</p>

<p>Philip became banal. “It is never too late to mend.
I’ve been hoping——”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t hope too violently, Philip mine. I am
a creature of impulse, and just now the spirit moves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
me to become a money grubber; to hang on to what
I have, and to plant it and watch it grow like Jack’s
beanstalk. Past that, the same spirit is moving me to
get acquainted with some really good people; if there
be any such in this infatuated town.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be snobbish. There are plenty of them,
no doubt.”</p>

<p>“You don’t happen to know any of them yourself,
do you?”</p>

<p>“Not socially; I wasn’t here long enough last spring
to go about any, though I did meet some of the solider
citizens in the railroad connection: Governor Evans,
‘Uncle Johnny’ Smith,—he owns the American House,
you know,—Colonel Eicholtz, Mr. Walter Cheesman,
the Barth brothers, Kountze, president of the Colorado
National; men like that, most of them old residents.”</p>

<p>“The ‘First Families,’” Bromley mused. “Of course
there would be some dating back to the ’sixties and the
ox-team and ‘Pike’s-Peak-or-bust’ days; not so very
ancient, at that, but still with the distinguishing hallmark
of the pioneers. We’ll fish around for some
introductions.”</p>

<p>Philip sat back in his chair, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“I’m not at all sure that I want to go in for the
social whirl just yet, Harry,” he deprecated. “I want
to find the Dabneys first, if I can; and after that ...
perhaps you may remember that I once told you what
my principal object was in heading for the west?”</p>

<p>“About your father; yes, I remember. You said
at the time that you had no definite clue to his whereabouts.
Has anything come to light since?”</p>

<p>“No; nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“Going to be a rather blind job, looking for him,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Utterly blind. It will be only by chance, if I find
him.”</p>

<p>“Any notion of how to go about the search?”</p>

<p>“No very clear idea, as yet. But now that I have
money and leisure—can go where I please and stay as
long as I please—well, to begin with, I had thought
of making a round of the different towns and mining-camps.
Of course, I’m not at all certain that he is in
Colorado. The Black Hills rush was the big excitement
when he dis—when he left home.”</p>

<p>“I see,” Bromley nodded; and, forbearing to add
any word either of curious questioning or of discouragement:
“Have you finished your coffee?”</p>

<p>“The coffee, yes,” Philip assented hesitantly. “But
there is a thing we’ve both been dodging, and we may
as well have it out here and now. What did you think
of me last night, Harry?”</p>

<p>Bromley smiled. “I thought you were completely
human; a fact I have at times been somewhat inclined
to doubt.”</p>

<p>Philip shook his head in reproachful deprecation.</p>

<p>“Do you make a joke out of everything?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. But in this transitory scheme which we
call Life, spelling it with a capital letter, I try to give
things their relative value—that’s all.”</p>

<p>Again Philip shook his head.</p>

<p>“Can a man touch pitch and not be defiled? I
wasn’t human, Harry; for the time being I was just
a brute beast.”</p>

<p>“Oh, good heavens! Are you going to let that bit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
commonplace asininity worry you for the rest of your
life? Let it slide and forget it. You didn’t do
that painted and powdered Jezebel any harm—you
couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not: the harm I did was to myself.... It
was the first time, Harry. I wish I could make you
believe that it will also be the last.”</p>

<p>Bromley pushed his chair back and got up, laughing
quietly.</p>

<p>“What your conscience needs, Philip, is a rain-coat.
You’re out for a lot of trouble if you let such things
soak in and make you soggy and uncomfortable, and
you’d find the rain-coat a profitable acquisition. Let’s
go get some cigars.”</p>

<p>Not knowing anything further to be done in the way
of tracing the lost Dabney family beyond waiting hopefully
for an answer to his note, Philip joined Bromley
in making a round of the rental agencies; and, when a
suitable double apartment was found, in selecting their
joint stock of furnishings. This done, a period of
inaction followed which was more trying than the
hardest labor he had ever performed. Under the goading
of unwonted idleness he grew moody and at times
almost irritable; a frame of mind that acquired an
added touch of moroseness when his note to Jean
Dabney was returned to him from the post-office with
“Uncalled for” rubber-stamped across the face of the
envelope. Bromley had made a few social acquaintances
and was constantly making more; but his efforts
to drag Philip out of the rut into which he had fallen
went for nothing.</p>

<p>“No, no—I wish you’d let up, Harry!” he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
say, when Bromley sought to include him in the invitations
which were coming in increasing numbers to the
breezy young Philadelphian. “I can’t talk silly nothings,
I don’t dance, and I hardly know one card from
another. Your new friends wouldn’t have any use
for me.”</p>

<p>“Or you for them, you might add,” retorted the play-boy.
“As a social animal you’re pretty nearly a total
loss, Philip. Keep it up, and in time you’ll be able to
give cards, spades and little casino to the sourest monk
of the desert and beat him blind at his own game.
Incidentally, you are headed right to join the procession
of the unattached and unfettered in this hurrah
city of the plain—the big bunch of fellows who are
finding all the bad doors wide open, and who won’t
take the trouble to knock at any of the decent ones.”</p>

<p>“You are preaching?—at me?” said Philip, with a
sober smile.</p>

<p>“Call it what you please. I’ve been all the gaits and
know what I’m talking about. You’ll get dry rot, and
that’s worse than the other kind because it doesn’t show
on the outside. You won’t think better of it and go
to Mrs. Demming’s little dinner-and-after with me?”</p>

<p>“Not to-night; I’m pretty comfortable as I am.
Chase along and have a good time in your own fashion.
As you say, I’m more or less hopeless on the social
side.”</p>

<p>With Bromley gone, he drew the deepest of the easy-chairs
up to the table, lighted the gas reading-lamp and
tried to lose himself in Howells’s <i>The Lady of the
Aroostook</i>, just out in book form; this until it should
be time to go out for his dinner in one of the hotels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
or restaurants. The book failed to hold him, and he
threw it aside, struggled into the light overcoat demanded
by the night breeze sweeping down from the
Snowy Range, and took to the streets.</p>

<p>Since it was still early in the evening the night life
of the city had scarcely begun. In Sixteenth Street the
horse-cars made cheerful music on the crisp evening
air with their jingling bells, and at each corner a group
of homing workers waited under the gas street-light
to board them. Philip drifted northward in the sidewalk
throng, absently oblivious of his surroundings
and curiously dissatisfied with himself and the new
outlook upon life engendered by the possession of
money. The free, hard-working, outdoor year, followed
by the golden flood which had swept away the
necessity for work of any kind, had broken orderly
habit, and a sort of deadening <i>ennui</i> was the result.
With all the healthy incentives to effort drowned in
the flood, he could settle upon no object that seemed
worth while. Upon the first day of his return to
Denver he had sent his mother and sisters a sum which,
as he knew, would postulate riches to the family of
plain-living New England women; but with this dutiful
channel filled—choked, for the time being, at least,
by the generous stream he had poured into it—he had
found no other reasonable use to which the golden
surfeit could be put.</p>

<p>While he was still drifting and trying aimlessly to
decide where he should go for his solitary dinner, he
stepped aside to make room for a group of women
workers coming out of a millinery shop. As he did so,
two things occurred in swift sequence: he collided violently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
with a heavy-set man hurrying in the opposite
direction, and in the rebound from the collision he
found himself clasping a young woman in his arms to
keep from knocking her down. Recovering his balance,
he was beginning to apologize when the young woman
gave a little cry of surprise and called him by name.
Then he saw that chance had succeeded where directed
effort had failed; that the young woman he had so
hastily embraced was Jean Dabney.</p>

<p>It was reticent habit, no less than the lapse of a
year, that tied his tongue and made his greeting awkwardly
formal; and the inability to be instantly at ease
made him rage inwardly. But the young woman helped
him out.</p>

<p>“I have wondered, so many times, if we should ever
meet again,” she was saying; and by this time he had
clubbed his inherited pauciloquy into subjection sufficiently
to say:</p>

<p>“I had almost given up the hope. I have been trying
all sorts of ways to find out what had become of you.”</p>

<p>“You have? That was kind, and—and neighborly.
And I don’t wonder that you couldn’t find us. It has
been nearly a year, and everything changes so quickly
out here.”</p>

<p>“It does,” he agreed; and then: “Where were you
going when I came so near knocking you down?”</p>

<p>“Home—to give the family a surprise. I don’t
usually get off before eight or nine at this season of
the year.”</p>

<p>“Get off?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Get out of the shop, I mean. You didn’t know I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
could be right industrious and useful, did you? I’m
trimming hats here in Madame Marchande’s.”</p>

<p>Once more Philip struggled with inborn constraint
and made himself say: “You said the family wouldn’t
be expecting you this early. I haven’t been to dinner—I
was just on my way. Won’t you go along and have
a bite with me?”</p>

<p>She hesitated, but only for a moment.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I shouldn’t, if you want me to.”
Then, as he drew her arm under his own and steered
her toward the Larimer Street corner; “You got the
note I wrote you last spring?”</p>

<p>“Not until just the other day, when I came back
from my year in the mountains. When I went away
last spring I didn’t leave any forwarding address; I
couldn’t, very well, because I hadn’t the remotest idea
where I was going to be from week to week. So my
mail was held here in the railroad office. Since I read
your note, I’ve been trying to find out what had become
of you and your mother and the girls, but I couldn’t
get even a starting point. You have been in Denver
all the time?”</p>

<p>“Yes; there was nothing to do but to stay here.”
Then, as they turned west on Larimer: “Where are
you taking me?”</p>

<p>“I thought we would go around to Charpiot’s—unless
you would rather make it the Windsor or the
St. James.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you mustn’t do anything like that!” she
protested quickly. “They are all three too horribly
expensive.”</p>

<p>He smiled under cover of the darkness, saying: “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
guess we can stand the expense, for once in a way.
We will go to Charpiot’s. Bero always has good
cooks; imports them from New Orleans, so they say.”
Then, in a gratulatory outburst as foreign to his later
moods—and to the New England traditions—as was
his praise of French cooks: “You can’t imagine what a
comfort it is to be with you again. I was beginning to
be afraid I had lost you for good and all.”</p>

<p>She acknowledged the outburst with a friendly little
pressure of his arm.</p>

<p>“It is nice to know that you hadn’t forgotten us.
How long did you say you have been back?”</p>

<p>“Only a few days; less than three weeks, to be
exact.”</p>

<p>“And you are working in the railroad office again?”
He did not answer because they were entering the
hotel and M’sieu Bero, successor to the man who had
made Charpiot’s the Delmonico’s of Denver, was
bustling forward to welcome them.</p>

<p>“Delight’ to see you, M’sieu Trask; <i>et vous</i>, Ma’mselle—or
is it the Madame?”</p>

<p>Philip flushed like an embarrassed boy and hastened
to stand his companion’s identity upon its proper feet.
“Miss Dabney,” he said. “She is from the South and
knows your New Orleans cooking. Can you put us
where we will be by ourselves?”</p>

<p>“But, yes! A private room up-stairs, maybe?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; not that,” Philip broke in, flushing again
at the too plain implication; “just a corner in the public
room where we can have a table together.”</p>

<p>“I fix you,” was the reply; and the table for two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
was secured, where Philip, sitting opposite his guest,
had his first good look at her in a strong light.</p>

<p>She was thinner than she had been a year earlier, and
the dark eyes had candlelight shadows under them;
still, the eyes were very much alive, and the thinness
had not marred the perfect oval of her face. There
was a lack of color in the pretty lips; that and a translucency
of skin hinting at confining work and long
hours, and, quite likely, he imagined, at sterner privations.
The thought of the privations stirred him
deeply. She was too fine and precious to be thrown
into the grinding mill of a struggle for existence.
Without doubt that was what had happened. She
was carrying the burden for the family of four, and
was, by her own admission, working all sorts of hours
doing it.</p>

<p>The dining-room was warm, and when she slipped
out of her coat he went around to hang it up for her.
With the coat in his hands he decided at once that
it was too thin for a Denver evening wrap. Also, he
noted that the collar and cuffs had been carefully turned
and darned; and the same observation went for the
tight-fitting basque with its bit of lace at the throat
and the unmistakable signs of wear on the sleeves.
Philip was not unfamiliar with the pinchings and
makeshifts of economy; he had known them at home.
But the signs of them here and now moved him
strangely, as if life, which had lightly tossed Bromley
and himself an incredible fortune, were bitterly unfair
to the weak and more deserving.</p>

<p>Going back to his place, he picked up the menu card
and asked her what she would like to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“After a day’s work everything tastes good to me,”
she answered, with the quick-flashing smile that carried
him instantly back to a double seat in the Kansas
Pacific day-coach and the spring-time afternoon when
they had shared it together. “Won’t you order for
both?”</p>

<p>He gave the dinner order, making it commensurate
with the healthy appetite he had brought back from
the mountains. After the waiter had left them, he
said: “You asked me as we were coming in if I had
gone back to work in the railroad office. I haven’t—as
yet.”</p>

<p>“But you are meaning to?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. You see, I have another job now. I
am keeping personal books for a chap who owns a
half-interest in a new mine on the other side of the
main range.”</p>

<p>She was not so easily misled as Middleton had been.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she said, with a little gasp; “then you <i>did</i>
find a mine?”</p>

<p>“Yes; after so long a time—after we had knocked
about digging foolish holes in the hills nearly all
summer.”</p>

<p>“‘We,’ you say. Did you really take the wild young
man with you? I have thought about him so often.”</p>

<p>“You mean Bromley?—the fellow who tried to hold
me up the night I went out to the tent colony to see
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You told me about him, you remember.”</p>

<p>He nodded. “Yes; he was the other half of the
‘we.’ He was my partner: he still is.”</p>

<p>“And did he—was he——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>A lack of loyalty was not one of Philip’s failings.</p>

<p>“You may remember what you said of him that night
a year ago. Your intuition hit the mark. Harry
Bromley has a heart of gold. He is a much better
man than I am.”</p>

<p>“A better man? In what way?”</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing, he has a much better sense of
values—the life values, you know. And for another,
he isn’t burdened with a New England conscience.
But I am forgetting. You don’t know anything about
New England and its conscience.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t throw my ignorance up at me,” she
bantered. “Where is Mr. Bromley now?”</p>

<p>“He is here in Denver; we have rooms together in
the Alamo Building. Just at this present moment he is
dining out with some new society friends he has been
acquiring—at a Mrs. Demming’s, I think he told me.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said; “the Demmings are rich people. I
know, because I trimmed a hat for the daughter last
week. But then, I suppose you and Mr. Bromley are
both rich, too, now.”</p>

<p>Philip smiled. “Not offensively so, yet; though
we both have money in the bank; rather more of it
than we know what to do with. But most of the riches
are still in the rough, as you might say. We have
leased our mine, and it won’t begin to pan out the real
thing until later in the summer.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know how glad I am!” she exclaimed,
and her eyes were shining.</p>

<p>“Glad for Harry, or for me?”</p>

<p>“For both of you, of course. I think it is perfectly
splendid—to go out into the wilderness that way and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
make it give you something that makes you richer and
doesn’t make anybody any poorer. I suppose you will
go back to Yankeeland now and live happily ever
after?”</p>

<p>“If I ran true to form, I imagine that is precisely
what I should do,” Philip admitted soberly. “But I’m
afraid I am not running true to form any more. This
country out here has done something to me. I don’t
know what it is, but I know that I don’t care to go
back east to live. Are you homesick for Mississippi?”</p>

<p>Her eyelids drooped, and he found himself wondering
why he hadn’t remembered how pretty and curved
and long her eyelashes were.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I am,” she confessed, with a deeper note
in her voice. “You see, it’s this way: when you leave
a place that has been home for you as far back as you
can remember.... But that is all over, now; there is
nothing for us to go back to.”</p>

<p>Her use of the plural reminded him that he had not
yet asked about the other members of the family. He
hastened to atone for the neglect.</p>

<p>“Mummie isn’t at all well; she has never been very
strong, you know. And Mysie and Mary Louise are
in school. We are keeping house, after a fashion.”
This was the brief reply his inquiry elicited; and then
the dinner began to come on.</p>

<p>It was an excellent dinner, as Philip had predicted
it would be, beginning with olives and celery and rich
chicken gumbo, and ending with a brandy-sauced
pudding for which Bero’s place was famous. Philip
was again touched sympathetically when he saw how
his table companion ate and when she broke into his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
story of the year afield to say, with a quaint twist of
the pretty lips: “You must think I’m a perfect pig, eating
the way I do; but I was awfully hungry. Some
days when we are rushed in the shop I don’t take time
to go out at noon. I didn’t to-day.”</p>

<p>He nodded understandingly, telling her to eat
heartily and give the house a good name; this by way
of covering his dismay at the conditions to which her
admission pointed. It was even worse than he had
prefigured. He was confident that it was only to save
her pride that she had pleaded the lack of time for a
midday meal. With three other mouths to fill, she
simply couldn’t afford a luncheon for herself—he knew
it. Not to be able to get enough to eat was horrible!</p>

<p>“How do you come to be trimming hats?” he asked,
trying to push aside the discomforting thoughts stirred
up by her tacit divulgence of the family poverty.</p>

<p>“It is my one little gift; and I didn’t know I had
it. Oh, of course, I have always trimmed my own—and
Mummie’s and the girls’; but that was nothing.
I was so glad I could have cried when I found that
somebody was willing to pay me money—real money—for
doing it.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I’ll bet they are not paying you half
enough,” he frowned. “And keeping you on until
eight or nine o’clock—that is a plain outrage!”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t find fault with my job,” she protested
laughingly. “I can tell you I was glad enough to get
it, in a city where almost all the places to work are
filled by men.”</p>

<p>Though he maneuvered cleverly to prolong it to the
uttermost, the excellent dinner came to an end all too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
soon; and when she asked him what time it was, and
he was obliged to tell her that it was a quarter past
eight, she rose in a little panic of haste, saying that
she must go home; that her mother would be worrying.</p>

<p>When he went around to help her into her coat he
again felt the lightness of it and swore inwardly at the
conventions that kept him from taking her out and
buying her a better one. Why couldn’t he do just
that? There was no reason save the silly inhibitions
which kept a man from doing for a woman in need
what he would be applauded for doing if the woman
were a man. He thought of Bromley and his saying
about the various ways of choking the cat. Would the
play-boy be able to find some way of helping this dear,
brave girl without hurting her pride? And if Bromley
could do it, why couldn’t he—Philip—contrive to do it?
It was a muddled world!</p>

<p>When he had paid for the dinners and had gone with
her to the sidewalk, she gave him a small surprise by
thanking him gratefully and trying to bid him good-by.</p>

<p>“But, see here!” he objected. “It isn’t ‘good-by’ yet.
Of course I am going to see you safely home. Do you
think I would turn you loose in the streets at this time
of night?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you wouldn’t want to do it in Yankeeland,
but you can do it safely enough here,” she argued.
“Haven’t you heard the Denver boast that, for all it
is such a ‘wide-open’ city, a woman who minds her own
affairs is safe in the streets at any time of the day
or night? And it is true, too—or almost true.”</p>

<p>“That may all be. Just the same, I am going to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
you home,” Philip insisted. “I owe it to my own self-respect,
if I don’t owe it to you. Do we walk or ride?”</p>

<p>“It is only a little way; and, really, Mr. Trask, I
wish you wouldn’t!”</p>

<p>“It is ‘Mr. Trask’ now, but it was ‘Philip’ last
spring,” he reminded her.</p>

<p>“Well, then—Philip, won’t you let me run away by
myself this time? We mustn’t stand here cluttering up
Mr. Charpiot’s sidewalk. Please!”</p>

<p>“Is there any really good reason why I shouldn’t
see you home?”</p>

<p>“N-no; I don’t reckon there is any <i>reason</i>.
Only——”</p>

<p>“Then that settles it. Come along,” and he made
her take his arm.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes the truth of her saying that
she had only a short distance to go was rudely thrust
upon him. A silent walk of two squares down the
nearest cross street toward the Platte ended at the
stair of a brick building dingy and old as age might be
reckoned in this Aladdin city of the plain; a building
whose sidewalk-fronting windows yawned into the
empty darkness of a former storeroom. And the
street in which it stood was the street of the Corinthian
plangencies. The neighborhood, as all Denver knew,
was not merely a shabby one; it was disreputable.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” he exclaimed, as they paused at the
dark stairfoot. “You don’t mean to tell me you are living
here!”</p>

<p>“You would come,” she answered reproachfully;
then: “We have rooms on the second floor. I—I’m
sorry I can’t ask you in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“But this neighborhood!” he expostulated, and the
sternest of his Puritan ancestors could not have
crowded more deprecation into the three words.</p>

<p>“I know,” she nodded. “But you remember the old
saying—that beggars mustn’t be choosers. We were
glad enough to find shelter anywhere. And the people
... they are not what they ought to be, perhaps; but
they are kind to us. Won’t you let me thank you again
and say good-night?”</p>

<p>Since there was nothing else to be done, he did it;
though he waited until after she had disappeared up
the unlighted stair before he turned to walk away, still
shocked and dismayed at the thought of two unprotected
women and two young girls living—being
obliged to live—in such surroundings. It shouldn’t be
permitted; it must not be permitted. Surely he and
Bromley together could hatch up some plan by means
of which Jean and her family could be helped; some
plan which they could accept without becoming objects
of charity.</p>

<p>It was at the Sixteenth Street corner that he came
suddenly upon Middleton. The former tonnage cleric,
clean shaven as to the beard, dapper and well fed, was
standing in a dark doorway, fingering his mustaches
and apparently waiting for some one.</p>

<p>“Hello, Philly!” he called. “Little off your beat
down here,—what?”</p>

<p>With no definite reason for so doing, Philip began
to bristle inwardly. Though he had worked with
Middleton and roomed with him, he had never been
quite able to conquer an ingrained aversion to the
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“It is a public street, isn’t it?” he suggested.</p>

<p>“That is the trouble with it; it is too public for a
truly good young man like yourself. Or perhaps you
are not so truly good as you used to be. How
about it?”</p>

<p>With the instinctive antagonism to prompt it, there
was a sharp reply on the end of Philip’s tongue. But
he suppressed it.</p>

<p>“I like to ramble around a little now and then in
the evenings,” he substituted; and Middleton laughed.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that you’ve become human
enough to do a little ‘chasing’ for yourself?”</p>

<p>Philip did not affect to misunderstand. With the
curious inner voice whispering that this was the proper
time to answer a fool according to his folly, he said
mildly: “Weren’t you continually setting me the example
last year?”</p>

<p>The dapper one laughed again.</p>

<p>“You might go so far as to say that I am still setting
it. I don’t mind telling you that right now I’m
camping on the trail of one of the choicest little bits
of womaninity you ever laid eyes on. If she shows
up, I shall promptly shoo you away.”</p>

<p>Philip’s lip curled. “One of the Corinthians?” he
queried.</p>

<p>“Not on your sweet life; nothing like it. She’s a
black-eyed, black-haired little darling, all frost on the
outside and fire on the inside—works in a millinery
shop and comes home about this time every evening.
She’s a little offish yet, but she’ll get over that pretty
soon.”</p>

<p>While one might count ten, the flaring gas street-lights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
turned darkly red for Middleton’s listener. But
his voice was low and quite controlled when he said,
“Of course you know her name?”</p>

<p>“Yep; she never would tell me, but I got it from one
of the girls she works with. It’s a boy’s name—Jean.”</p>

<p>Nothing is more certain than that the inhibitions are
dependent, more often than not, upon purely extraneous
circumstances: environment, the mental attitude of the
moment, even such trivial influences as the cut of one’s
clothes and the obligations imposed thereby. Clad in
a flannel shirt, baggy trousers and miner’s boots,
Philip had thought nothing of the civilized restraints
when he had flung himself, tooth and nail, upon the
drunken bully who was menacing Bromley in the bar-room
of the Leadville hotel. But now, with the
mining-camp rawnesses put safely behind him, the
conventional fetterings were not so easily broken.
Middleton was a petty libertine, to be sure, but he
knew that a few straightforward words of explanation
about the Dabney family and his own connection with
it would put an end to the ex-tonnage clerk’s pursuit
of the daughter.</p>

<p>But the cool words were not spoken. In the moment
of hesitation the curious inner voice prompted
vengefully, “Will you stand for that? Haven’t you
found out yet that you are in love with Jean Dabney—the
girl to whom this fat rake is offering the bitterest
insult a man of his breed can offer to a woman of
hers?” and at this flame-hot goading the inhibitory
bonds became as smoking flax and he lashed out with a
swift, fury-driven uppercut to the smooth-shaven jaw.</p>

<p>At the smacking impact of the totally unexpected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
blow the fat victim gasped, gurgled, tried to duck aside
and stumbled and fell on the sidewalk. There were no
passers-by to interfere, and for a single instant Philip
stood looking down upon his handiwork in a fit of half-awed
astonishment. Then the mad vengeance wave
submerged him again and he sprang upon the fallen
man, beating him futilely and trying to grind his face
into the pavement. And at the last:</p>

<p>“Get up, you dirty hound!—get up and run if you
want to go on living! If you ever so much as look at
that girl again, I’ll cut your rotten heart out and feed
it to the dogs in the street! Run! you damned——”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Bromley came in at half-past eleven, glowing
from his brisk walk in the cool night air from the
Demming house in upper Fourteenth Street, he found
that Philip had not yet gone to bed; was sitting with
his hands locked over a knee and an extinct pipe between
his teeth, his face the face of a man frowningly
at odds with himself and his world.</p>

<p>“Heavens, Phil!” was the play-boy’s greeting, “You
look as if you had lost every friend you ever had and
never expected to find another. What’s gnawing you
now?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you would call it nothing,” returned the
loser moodily. “I’ve merely been finding out that
I can be still another and different kind of a crazy
fool.”</p>

<p>Bromley grinned. “You have been to the Corinthian
again?”</p>

<p>“Oh, hell—no! I said a different kind of a fool.
Drop it, Harry. I don’t want to talk about it.”</p>

<p>Thus extinguished, Bromley slipped out of his
overcoat, struggled into a smoking jacket, and filled
and lighted his pipe; all this in comradely silence.
After a time the mere fact of his presence seemed to
exert a mollifying effect, for when Philip spoke again
it was to say, less irritably: “I have found the Dabney
family, at last.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Good!” exclaimed the play-boy. “Nothing so very
foolish about that. How did it eventuate?”</p>

<p>In clipped sentences Philip told of the accidental
street meeting with Jean, and of the dinner <i>à deux</i>
at Charpiot’s, winding up with: “It fairly gave me a
heartache to see how hungry she was. She said she
hadn’t had time to go out to luncheon, but I am morally
certain that was only half of the truth. The other half
was that she couldn’t afford to feed herself in the
middle of the day.”</p>

<p>Bromley whistled softly.</p>

<p>“Say, Philip, that is tough! I know, because I have
been there myself. What else did you find out?”</p>

<p>“After dinner I walked home with her, though she
didn’t want me to. When we reached the place I saw
why she had tried to shake me. They are living in a
shabby tenement block down there within a stone’s
throw of the Corinthian. She apologized for not being
able to ask me in.”</p>

<p>“Suffering Scott!—in <i>that</i> neighborhood? Wasn’t
there anybody to tell them what they were getting into
down there?”</p>

<p>“She gave me to understand that there was no
choice; that they were obliged to take shelter where
they could find it—and afford it. They know—or at
least she does—what sort of people they are mixing
with. She says they are kind to her and her mother
and the children.”</p>

<p>Bromley nodded slowly. “People of that sort would
be—to hard-luck people of her sort. That is one of
the queer things in this mixed-up world of ours. So
far as sheer safety is concerned, she is probably just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
as safe in that tenement dive as she would be in the
most respectable mansion in Denver. All the same, we
ought to get them out of there. Have you thought of
anything?”</p>

<p>“No; I can’t think. I had a crazy fit just after she
left me, and I haven’t been able to think of much else
since.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you unload on me and get it off your
chest,” Bromley suggested.</p>

<p>“I will, because you ought to know. If you are to
go on living in the same apartment with a howling
maniac——”</p>

<p>“All right; tell me what the maniac has been doing.”</p>

<p>“You have heard me speak of Middleton, the fat-faced
railroad clerk I was rooming with when you first
met me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t half a bad fellow in some ways, but, like
a good many others in this demoralized town, he has
a rotten streak in him. He is—or was—engaged to a
girl back in Ohio; but that hasn’t kept him from chasing
all sorts of women out here. To-night, after I
left Jean, I found him loafing on the nearest street
corner. He told me he was waiting for a girl; a girl
who worked in a millinery shop. I led him on until he
told me her name, which he had got from one of her
girl workmates. He said it was a boy’s name—Jean.”</p>

<p>“You labored with him in good, old Puritan-dominie
fashion?” said Bromley, with a crooked smile.</p>

<p>“You know mighty well I didn’t; though that would
have been the sensible thing to do. He has an obscene
twist in his brain, but for all that, I have no reason to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
believe that he hasn’t some decent limitations. If I
had told him who the Dabneys are, and that they are
friends of mine, that would have settled it. Instead of
doing that, I went crazy mad—knocked him down and
beat him—made a shouting ass of myself.”</p>

<p>Bromley laughed and thrust a hand across the reading
table.</p>

<p>“Shake—you old fighting Roundhead!” he said.
“Now I know you are all human! Is that what you
were looking so glum about? You needn’t lose any
sleep over such a little gust of righteous indignation
as that. As a matter of fact, you ought to sleep the
better for it.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Philip soberly. “It isn’t the mere fact
that Middleton got what he was asking for; it is the
other and bigger fact that I am no longer my own
man, Harry. The frantic gold chase we have been
through has done something to me; I don’t know
what it is; but I do know I am not the man I was
when I left New Hampshire a little more than eighteen
months ago. I’m hag-ridden—possessed of a dumb
devil. Every now and then I am made to realize that
there are hellish possibilities in me that I never even
dreamed of before I came out here.”</p>

<p>Bromley grew philosophical.</p>

<p>“The possibilities, hellish or otherwise, active or
dormant, lie in every man of us born of woman, Philip.
If we are, at bottom, creatures of heredity, on the
surface we are pretty strictly creatures of environment;
by which I mean that the environment calls to the
surface only those qualities in us that are in harmony
with it—that will respond to it. Back home, I take it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
you had your little commonplace round and lived in it.
Out here, all the traditional strings are off, and we are
free to revert to type, if we feel like it.”</p>

<p>“M-m,” said Philip, thin-lipped; “very pretty—in
theory. But it doesn’t get me anywhere. You can’t
argue from the general to the particular; not in my
case, anyway.”</p>

<p>There was the wisdom of the wise fools of all the
ages in Bromley’s smile.</p>

<p>“Of course; you want to be specialized. We all do.
I’ve prophesied for you before, and I can do it again
if you want me to. You are of the tribe of those who
have to emerge through great tribulation. There is
a strong man and a broad man inside of you, Philip,
and some day he will break out and come to his own.
When he does, there will probably be a great smashing
of window-panes and a kicking-out of door panels—wreckage
a-plenty—and after it is all over you will
doubtless wonder why there had to be an earthquake
in your particular case. But the fact will remain.”</p>

<p>Philip grunted. “Are you trying to tell me that I
am hidebound?”</p>

<p>“Call it that, if you like. Life is little to you yet;
some day you will see how wide the horizons really
are. But, as I say, you are likely to pay for the privilege—pay
in advance. It’s coming to you.”</p>

<p>Silence for a few moments while the smoke curled
upward in delicate little rings from Bromley’s pipe.
Then Philip said soberly: “You spoke a while back of
reversion to type. I don’t know what type it is that
I am reverting to. My people are all decent and well
behaved, as far back as I know anything about them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“Oh, that,” said Bromley lightly. “When it comes to
ancestors and the heredities, most of us can find anything
we are looking for, if we go back far enough.
It is a family tradition of ours that there was once a
Wigglesworth who was a raw-head-and-bloody-bones
pirate and wound up by getting himself hanged in
chains. I shouldn’t worry, if I were you.”</p>

<p>“That is just the difference between us, Harry,” was
the somber rejoinder. “You wouldn’t worry if you
knew the world were coming to an end to-morrow.
I don’t happen to be built that way. For a time this
evening, while I was with Jean Dabney, I was able to
recognize myself as the normal Philip Trask. But a
few minutes after we parted I was a bloody murderer—in
all but the actual accomplishment of the thing;
I could have killed Middleton without a qualm. If the
crazy fit had lasted a minute or two longer, I don’t
doubt but I should have killed him.”</p>

<p>“Well, you didn’t kill him; which is the main thing,
after all. Let it go. You’ve got it out of your system
now. I suppose your silly conscience will make you
go and apologize to the masher, but that’s a future—a
bridge to be crossed when you come to it. Let’s
talk about me for a while. I’ve had a jolt, too, to-night.”</p>

<p>“A jolt? You don’t look it.”</p>

<p>“That’s it; no matter how sick a fellow is, if he
doesn’t look sick he gets no sympathy. Just the same,
I’m stabbed to the heart. I have been discovered.”</p>

<p>Philip’s smile was grim, but it was a smile.
“Sheriff after you with a warrant?” he bantered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Worse. At Mrs. Demming’s to-night I met a man
who knows me—knew me back home, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Anything fatal about that?”</p>

<p>“The fatality lies in what he told me. Have I ever,
by any chance, happened to mention the Follansbees to
you?”</p>

<p>“Not that I remember.”</p>

<p>“Friends of the family for three generations. Tom
Follansbee was my classmate in college for the little
time the powers that were let me stay on the campus.
My governor and the Judge were also classmates. You
get the idea?—the two families as thick as peas in a
pod?”</p>

<p>“I’m listening.”</p>

<p>“Just a minute and you’ll get the full impact of my
jolt. There are two daughters, Eugenia and Lucy Ann.
Back in the dark ages, when we were both in frocks
and pinafores, the two families settled it that Eugenia
and I were to marry when we grew up.”</p>

<p>“And when you did grow up you both revolted?”</p>

<p>“No; only one of us—more’s the pity. I’m a worse
rotter than your man Middleton. Of course I like
Eugie—like her immensely; we grew up together. The
trouble is she likes me; not wisely, but a lot too well.
She has always taken the pinafore arrangement as a
settled thing. I am afraid she still takes it that way.”</p>

<p>“Well, there isn’t any other ‘one and only’ in the
case, is there?”</p>

<p>“Not so you could observe it. But that isn’t the
question. I haven’t any conscience—not in your meaning
of the word—but I have something that partly
answers the same purpose. I don’t want to be cajoled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
into marrying a woman that I don’t love in a marrying
way. It would be a sorry bargain for the woman.”</p>

<p>“I see. But this is all back-number stuff. Where
does your jolt come in?”</p>

<p>“At the front door, and as large as life. The
younger sister’s health isn’t good; weak lungs. Thurlow—he’s
the chap I met at Mrs. Demming’s—tells
me that the whole Follansbee clan is about to come to
Colorado to try the effect of the altitudes on Lucy Ann.
Philip, old boy, I’m a ruined community!”</p>

<p>Philip smiled again, less grimly, this time. The play-boy
was presenting another facet of his many-sided
character, an entirely new and different one.</p>

<p>“Afraid the charming Eugenia will marry you out
of hand?” he jested.</p>

<p>“You’ve hit the nail squarely on the head! If she
could find me as you found me last spring—a shameless
down-and-out—there might be some hope for me. But
now ... it’s a fearful price to have to pay for bracing
up, Philip!”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do about it—dodge?”</p>

<p>“I can’t dodge. Thurlow will meet the Follansbees
when they arrive, and the first thing he will tell them—oh,
pot! don’t you see that I’m in for it up to my
neck?”</p>

<p>Philip tossed his cold pipe aside and got out of his
chair.</p>

<p>“Better go to bed and sleep on it,” he counselled.
“Perhaps it won’t seem so much like an unmixed
misfortune in the morning.” And as he reached his
bed-room door: “This Miss Follansbee—is she good-looking,
Harry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“A glorious blonde, handsome enough to make your
hair curl.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Philip; “it strikes me you might be
a lot worse off than you are. You might have epilepsy,
or rheumatism, or small-pox, or something of that
sort. Good-night.” And he went off to bed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Exuberant</span> Denverites of the early ’eighties—not
the bull-team pioneers of the ’sixties, most of whom
looked on with dry humor, but the clamant majority
of tenderfoot later comers—lived strenuously in a
boosters’ Paradise, acclaiming their city the Queen of
the Plains and extolling impartially its Italian skies,
health-giving atmosphere and matchless scenic surroundings;
its phenomenal growth, wealth and hilarious
“wide-openness.”</p>

<p>To this trumpeting mother of mining-camps came
the Follansbees, fresh from an America which was
slow to concede an America west of the Alleghenies;
the judge, a fine, upstanding gentleman of the old
school, with silvering hair and beard; his wife, an
ample and gracious lady corseted to the moment and
expert in the use of fan and lorgnette; their son
Thomas, a spectacled young man who had had a post-graduate
year at Oxford, returning with a pronounced
English accent and as the introducer of the curious
English custom of wearing spats; an elder daughter
fully bearing out Bromley’s description of her as a
“glorious blonde,” and a younger, thin and pale, with
wistful eyes looking out upon a world which would
always be alien to them.</p>

<p>True to his traditions, Bromley joined Thurlow in
meeting the migrants-for-health’s-sake at the Union<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
Depot, saw them carriaged for their hotel, saw to the
transfer of their luggage, and afterward called at the
hotel, dutifully and at the proper hour, to pay his respects
and to place himself, as a somewhat seasoned
Denverite, at the service of the family in helping to
find summer quarters in which the invalid Lucy Ann
could have the benefits to be derived from the miracle-working
climate.</p>

<p>“Their reactions to the ‘wild and woolly’ are delightful
to behold,” Bromley told Philip that night at
dinner. “The judge and Lucy Ann take things as
they are; but Mrs. Aurelia and Tom and Eugie are
distinctly disappointed at finding themselves surrounded
by all the comforts and most of the luxuries
of civilization. I don’t know just what they were
expecting to find, but they evidently haven’t found it—yet.”</p>

<p>“They will live at the Windsor?” Philip asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; their idea is to take a ‘villa,’ as Tom calls
it, somewhere in the suburbs and settle down in a
housekeeping way. And, by the by, Tom is a joke—a
shout! He used to be a rather decent chap, as
harmless as a cockroach; a trifle on his toes, perhaps,
because the Follansbees date back to Colonial times, but
otherwise quite bearable. But he spent last year in
England, at Oxford, and now he does everything but
drop his ‘h’s.’ He was out with me this afternoon
and he wore a top hat and spats. The grins we met,
if put end to end, would reach from here to Leadville.
He calls me ‘my deah fellaw.’”</p>

<p>“And the fair Eugenia?” Philip inquired maliciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>Bromley sighed and shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m still a ruined community. She is as fair as
ever and she hasn’t changed a particle. I was in hopes
some really good chap had cut in by this time, but I
am afraid she is still taking the parental bargain as a
matter of course.”</p>

<p>Philip’s grin was sardonic.</p>

<p>“And as long as she does, you’ll have to. Still, this
is a man’s town, and perhaps you won’t bulk so large
in the lady’s imagination after she has had time to
look the Western collection over.”</p>

<p>Bromley shook his head again. “I shall feel like a
cad doing it, but she shan’t lack for introductions,
Phil; I’ll promise you that. Want to go around to the
Windsor with me after dinner and meet them?”</p>

<p>Philip’s laugh was a bray. “And let you start the
introductions with me? Thanks, I wouldn’t be that
unkind to you,” he bantered.</p>

<p>“Let’s talk about something pleasant,” Bromley
broke in whimsically; “our friends from Mississippi,
for example. You remember the little rescue plan we
were talking about last week?”</p>

<p>“I remember telling you that it wouldn’t work.”</p>

<p>“But it has worked—like a charm. I bought the
West Denver cottage Saturday: you know the neighborhood—respectable
and neat, but not gaudy—short
walk across the Curtis Street bridge to the University
School for the girls—short walk to business for the
dear little hat-trimmer. After I’d got the deed safely
in my pocket, I called upon Mrs. Dabney and told her
what I had ‘found.’ She wept tears of joy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how you do it,” said Philip discontentedly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
“As many times as I have been with Jean
since I took her to dinner that first evening, she has
never let me see the inside of their rooms in the Whittle
Block.”</p>

<p>The play-boy laughed.</p>

<p>“You know the saying about fools rushing in where
angels fear to tread. I got my foot in the door the first
time I walked home with her—the day you went to
Boulder. The younger girls took to me and called me
‘Uncle Harry’; and after that it was easy.”</p>

<p>“Still, I don’t see how you got Mrs. Dabney’s consent
to fall in with your cottage scheme. I tried to
offer Jean a loan, and she froze me so quick——”</p>

<p>“Of course she would. That was what you might
call the heavy-hand method. I had to tell a few white
lies about the cottage, but that was all in the day’s
work. A mining friend of mine was moving his
family to the Gunnison country and was willing to let
his furnished house cheap to the right kind of tenants.
Past that, all that was needed was to make the rent fit
the Dabney purse.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t fooled Jean with any such cock-and-bull
story as that.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I? That remains to be seen. Anyway,
they are taking possession to-morrow, and I’m to help
them. You are not in it; not in one side of it.”</p>

<p>“Evidently,” was the morose agreement. Then:
“As I said before, I’d like to know how you do it,
Harry. You can get closer to people in ten minutes
than I can in a year. The first evening we were together
with Jean I could see that she accepted you that
quick,”—with a snap of his finger. “And she knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
what you are—or rather what you were a year ago.
Don’t women, good women, care whether or not a man
makes a consummate fool of himself?”</p>

<p>Instead of laughing at this acerbic thrust, his usual
reply to Philip’s censorious references to his past,
Bromley grew thoughtfully silent. When he spoke, it
was to say: “You may analyze women, good, bad and
indifferent, until the cows come home, Philip, but you’ll
never fully understand them; no man ever does, I
think. That remark of yours rubs shoulders with a
pretty large truth. There is a good deal of talk nowadays
about the double standard. It is the women—the
good women—who, unconsciously, perhaps, do the
most to maintain it. Why a man who has sown a
pretty generous acreage of wild oats should stand a
better chance with a good woman than the other sort
of man—your sort—is a question that has puzzled better
brains than yours or mine. But the fact seems to
remain.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” said Philip doggedly.</p>

<p>“All right; your belief isn’t obligatory, and we
won’t quarrel over it. You asked me a question and
I gave you the best answer I had in the box. Would
you like to amble across Cherry Creek and have a look
at my ‘mining friend’s’ cottage on the west side? It is
too fine an evening to be wasted indoors. Besides,
you’ll want to know the way.”</p>

<p>Together they walked down Larimer and across the
bridge, turning south in a street paralleling Cherry
Creek. Three short squares brought them to a darkened
cottage on a corner; a small box of a place with
a pocket-handkerchief lawn and two half-grown cottonwoods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
for shade trees. Bromley found a key and they
went in. When the gas was lighted, Philip looked
around. There were three bed-rooms, a sitting-room,
a small dining-room and a lean-to kitchen, all plainly
but comfortably furnished. True, the carpets were
worn and the furniture did not match; but there was
a home-like air about the place that made it seem as
if the former owners had just stepped out.</p>

<p>“Did you buy it all, just as it stands?” Philip asked.</p>

<p>“No, indeed. Just the empty house. I spent a whole
day ransacking the second-hand shops for the fittings;
didn’t dare buy anything new, naturally—that would
have been a dead give-away. Like it?”</p>

<p>“It will do well enough—considering who did it.
Of course, it’s understood that you let me in with you
on the expense?”</p>

<p>Bromley did not reply at once. When he did, his
answer was a conditional refusal.</p>

<p>“No, I think not, Phil. You don’t owe Jean Dabney
anything, and I do. If the time ever comes when you
are in debt to her as I am, we’ll have an accounting.
If you have seen all you want to, let’s go.” And he
reached up to turn off the gas.</p>

<p>In their common sitting-room that evening, while
Bromley was chuckling over a magazine article which
showed how little the writer really knew about the
Colorado to which he had evidently made no more than
a flying visit, Philip shut the <i>The Lady of the Aroostook</i>
upon a place-keeping finger to say:</p>

<p>“I think I owe it to myself to tell you that I went
to Middleton to-day and apologized.”</p>

<p>“Of course; I knew you’d do that, sooner or later,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
returned the play-boy, with his best impish grin.
“That is what you get for having a conscience. What
did he say?”</p>

<p>“He was very decent about it; doesn’t seem to bear
malice. Shook hands with me when I got up to go
and said he couldn’t blame me so very much for ‘losing
my temper.’ Altogether, he made me feel like a fool—or
rather like a whited sepulchre.”</p>

<p>“Why the simile?” queried the magazine reader.</p>

<p>“Because I profess better things, and he doesn’t. He
is a hopeless pagan, but he shows a better Christian
spirit than I did.”</p>

<p>This time Bromley’s grin was good-naturedly
cynical.</p>

<p>“Deep down in your heart, Philip, you don’t really
believe any such thing as that; you know you don’t,”
he said accusingly.</p>

<p>“Why don’t I?”</p>

<p>“Because, at this very moment, the old self-righteous
Puritan in you is patting itself on the back for its
superior virtue and for the humility in which you kept
the letter of the Gospel to your own satisfaction and
comfort.”</p>

<p>“Oh, to the devil with you and your hair-splitting
philosophy!” said Philip impatiently; and, relighting
his pipe, he went on with his reading of the Howells
novel.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> spring of 1881, memorable for the jangling
aftermath of the bitter factional political struggle of
the previous year which had resulted in the nomination
and election of President Garfield, waned to its close,
and on the second of July the nation was shocked by
the news flashed over the wires of the shooting of the
President in a Washington railway station by Charles
J. Guiteau.</p>

<p>Isolated by distance from the populous East and
Middle West, the new Colorado yet felt the shock and
responded to it. Partisanship and the harsh pre-election
epithets of “329” and the anti-Chinese cry of
“Remember the Morey letter” were forgotten, and
the city of the plain marked its sorrow and indignation,
as it did everything else, with a magnificent Western
gesture.</p>

<p>Philip, now following out his plan of a blind search
for his father in the various mountain mining-camps,
returned to Denver early in the week following the
national tragedy with other failures to add to those
which had gone before.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t let it dig too deep into you,” Bromley
urged sympathetically, after the story of the added
failures had been told. “You know you admitted in
the beginning that there was only the slenderest chance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
that you might turn him up here in Colorado. You
haven’t had any later clues, have you?”</p>

<p>“It is all groping in the dark,” was the discouraged
answer. “All I am sure of is that he would bury himself
out of sight. To be the first of his name to have
the finger of suspicion pointed at him, however unjustly
... you’d have to be New England born
yourself to know how these things cut to the bone,
Harry.”</p>

<p>Something of the same nature he said to Jean Dabney
that evening as he was walking home with her
from Madame Marchande’s. He had long since told
her about the cloud on the Trask name, and of his determination
to dispel it; as he made no doubt it could
be dispelled if he could trace his father and persuade
him to return to New Hampshire, there to fight the
good fight of reinstatement with half the wealth of
a Colorado gold mine to back him.</p>

<p>“I do hope you will succeed,” said the one who was
to the full as sympathetic as Bromley. “You owe it
to him to do your very best to find him.”</p>

<p>“To him, and quite as much to myself,” Philip
amended decisively. “While the cloud remains, it
rests upon all of us who bear the Trask name. Until
it is cleared away I can’t ask any right-minded woman
to marry me.”</p>

<p>They had reached the bridge over Cherry Creek and
had paused to look down upon the damp sands lying
dark in the starlight The young woman’s tone was
merely argumentative when she said: “Don’t you
think that is carrying it rather far?”</p>

<p>“Not as I see it. The name a man gives to his wife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
ought not to have even a shadow of disgrace upon it.
Don’t you believe that?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, I suppose I do,” was the half-hesitant reply.
“Yet that seems frightfully sweeping, when you come
to think of it. It seems to shut out all idea of repentance
and forgiveness.”</p>

<p>“Take it home,” said Philip shortly. “Would you
marry a man who had a bad record, or whose father
had been accused of a crime and was still lying under
that accusation?”</p>

<p>She was still staring down at the dark sands in the
creek channel.</p>

<p>“Since the beginning of time both men and women
have been forgiving worse things.”</p>

<p>Never before in their renewed acquaintance had he
felt so strongly the difference that a year’s burden of
heavy responsibilities courageously taken up and carried
had made in the dark-eyed young woman standing
beside him. It was only at rare intervals that a flash
of the old-time, teasing mockery came to the surface.
He told himself that her burden had not only sobered
her; it had brought her too crudely in contact with a
world of compromises—ethical compromises. He remembered
what Bromley had said about the double
standard of morals, and the part good women played
in maintaining or condoning it, and the recollection
brought a bitter taste in his mouth.</p>

<p>“If women like you take that attitude, what is the
use of a man’s trying to keep his record clean?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>“Dear me! How savagely righteous you can be!”
she exclaimed with a little laugh. Then she cleared the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
air with a plain-spoken declaration that served to increase
the aloes taste in his mouth: “I suppose I am
like other women. When the time comes—if it ever
does come—that I think enough of a man to marry
him, I shan’t ask what he has been; only what he is
and means to be.”</p>

<p>“That is heroic—but entirely wrong,” he decided
magisterially. “My code is stricter than that, and it
applies to men and women alike. I mean to be able
to give as much as I ask. If I can’t give, I shan’t
ask.”</p>

<p>“What terrible spiritual pride!” she commented,
laughing again. Then, soberly: “Don’t you know, I
shall be truly sorry for the woman you marry.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?”</p>

<p>“Because you don’t know women at all—or yourself.
And, besides, you don’t know the meaning of love; the
unselfish kind that takes for better or worse. Let’s
not talk about such things. We always get lost in the
woods when we do. Where shall you go next to look
for your father?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t decided. There are some camps in the
San Juan that I haven’t been to. Perhaps I shall go
down there next.”</p>

<p>They went on across the bridge and presently reached
the cottage on the west side. At the gate Philip declined
Jean’s invitation to come in. The bitter taste
was still with him, and as he walked slowly back to
town he was placing Bromley as the figurant upon
whom Jean’s tacit defense of the sinners was based.
The play-boy’s acceptance by the Dabneys one and all
was of the unreserved sort that Bromley seemed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
able to win wherever he went, and it was he who
oftenest walked home with Jean when she was kept
late in the millinery shop.</p>

<p>Philip assured himself that he wasn’t jealous; he
was merely sorry. Jean was much too fine to be wasted
upon a man who, by his own confession, had “gone
all the gaits.” True, Bromley showed no indications
of any desire to return to his wallowing in the mire;
but that made no difference: he <i>had</i> wallowed, and
Jean knew it—knew it and was willing to condone.
That was the bitter part of it. Did she, in common
with other women he had heard of, accept the devil’s
maxim that a reformed rake makes the best husband?</p>

<p>And about this business of reform: how deep did
it go? Was there ever any such thing as a complete
reintegration? Could a man—or a woman—ever
fully regain the heights from which the descent had
begun? Admitting that Bromley had a heart of gold,
as he—Philip—had once characterized him for Jean,
wasn’t he at best but a brand snatched from the burning?
And though the brand might not spring alight
again, wouldn’t there always be the charred scar and
the ashes?</p>

<p>Philip climbed the stair in the Alamo Building determined
to have a straight talk with Bromley. But
the time proved to be unpropitious. The play-boy was
dressing to go out—conscripted for a theater party with
the Follansbees, as he put it. “Have to be decently
chummy, of course,” he grumbled, “but I’d much rather
go across the Creek and play parchesi with Mysie and
Mary Louise.” Then: “That reminds me of something
I’ve been chewing on ever since you went away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
this last time, Phil. Even with the rent of the cottage
as low as I dared put it without giving the whole snap
away, the load is still too heavy for Jean—much too
heavy. Can’t you see it?”</p>

<p>Philip nodded. “I have seen it all along. I don’t
know what Madame Marchande is paying Jean, but it
stands to reason it isn’t enough to keep a family of four
properly alive.”</p>

<p>“You can bet your bottom dollar it isn’t. I’ve been
with them enough to note the little pinchings and
scrimpings and they make my heart bleed. It is up to
us, one or the other of us, to climb into the breach, and
I have found the way to do it. There is a spare bed-room
in the cottage, and last evening I asked Mrs.
Dabney if she would be willing to take a lodger. She
was so willing that she cried.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Philip.</p>

<p>“As I say, it’s up to us—or one of us; the room isn’t
big enough for two.”</p>

<p>“Go over there and live with them, you mean?”</p>

<p>“That’s it. And since they were your friends before
they were mine, you shall have the first chance at it.
But if you don’t go, I shall. They need the money.
Think it over, and we’ll thresh it out after I come
back.”</p>

<p>For some time after Bromley had gone, Philip sat
in his reading chair thrilling to his finger-tips. To live
under the same roof with Jean; to be with her daily
in the close intimacies of the home life; to be able to
help her legitimately in the carrying of her heavy
burden until the time should come when, his own filial
duty discharged and the Trask name cleared, he might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
persuade her to shift the burden to his shoulders—to
his and not to Harry Bromley’s.... There was only
one fly in this precious pot of ointment: that saying of
Jean’s scarcely an hour old: “I suppose I am like other
women. When the time comes—if it ever does come—that
I think enough of a man to marry him, I shan’t
ask what he has been; only what he is and means to
be.” Was she trying to tell him that Bromley was the
man?</p>

<p>It was in that hour that the virtuous ego rose to its
most self-satisfied height. Jean, wise in the hard
school of adversity but innocent as a child in matters
touching her soul’s welfare, should be made to see that
she must not risk her future happiness by marrying any
man who, however lovable, had once shown the weak
thread in the fabric of his character and might show
it again. It should be his task to make her see it; to
convince her that her duty to herself and to her unborn
children lay in quite a different direction.</p>

<p>In the levitating exhilaration of this thought the
room suddenly became too close and confining to contain
him, and he put on his coat and hat and descended
to the street. Conscious only of an urge to keep
moving, he began to walk aimlessly, through Curtis to
Sixteenth Street, past the new opera house now nearing
completion, and so on down toward Larimer.</p>

<p>It was in the final block that he saw something that
jerked him down out of the clouds and set his feet
upon the pavement of the baser realities. In the center
of the block was one of the evidences of Denver’s
“wide-openness”: a luxurious gambling palace running,
like many others in the city of the moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
without let or hindrance from the police. Through
the green baize swinging doors, as he was passing,
Philip saw an entering figure and recognized it.</p>

<p>“Jim Garth!” he muttered, and hung upon his heel.
He knew that Bromley had been “staking” the big
miner from time to time, and had himself refused point
blank to join in the contributions, arguing that it was
not only good money thrown away, but that it was
merely giving a man of ungoverned appetites the means
of further degrading himself. But now, in an upsurge
of righteous responsibility—the legitimate child of the
thoughts he had been entertaining—he was moved to
lay a restraining hand upon this weak-willed giant
who had toiled with him and Bromley through the
bitter winter in the Saguache. Before he realized exactly
what he meant to do, or how he should go about
it, he had pushed the swinging doors apart and was
ascending the softly carpeted stair.</p>

<p>At the top of the stair he found a doorkeeper guard,
but with a single appraising glance the man let him
pass into the room beyond. For a moment he stood
just inside the door, blinking and bewildered. The
transition from the cool outdoor air and semi-darkness
of the street to the brilliant light and smoke-drenched
atmosphere of the crowded upper room dazed him. It
was the first time he had ever set foot within a gambling
“hell,” and it was some little time before he
could force himself to begin a slow circuit of the room
in search of Garth.</p>

<p>To the soul inspired by predetermined righteousness
the scene was a blasting commentary on the depravity
of human nature. The haggard, eager, lusting faces of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
some of the players contrasting with the blank immobility
of others—the seasoned gamblers; the monotonous
click of the chips as some nervous amateur ran
them through his fingers; the skirling spin of the roulette
balls followed by the <i>rat-tat-tat</i> as they came to
rest in the red or black.... Philip saw and heard and
hastened, with a feeling that if he should linger too
long the fell madness of the place might somehow
obtain a lodgment in his own brain. He must find
Garth quickly and drag him out.</p>

<p>It was at the upper end of the room that he came to
a green-covered table with inlaid cards in its center and
a double row of players ringing it, the inner row sitting
and the outer standing. Upon a high stool at one end
sat the “lookout,” a man with the face of a graven
image and watchful eyes that marked each bet as it was
placed upon the table; and at one side sat the dealer,
turning up cards with practiced dexterity out of the
nickel-plated box on the table before him.</p>

<p>Philip’s gaze swept the ring of faces until he came
to that of the shirt-sleeved dealer, flipping the cards
two by two with automatic precision out of the box
under his hands. One glance at the clean-cut, deeply
lined face with its cold eyes, thin nostrils and lean jaw
was all that was needed, and Philip’s heart skipped a
beat and stood still. His fruitless search of the past
few weeks for his father had ended—<i>here</i>!</p>

<p>Gropingly, and as if his sight had suddenly failed
him, he edged his way around the table and touched
the shirt-sleeved man on the shoulder. The cold gray
eyes were lifted to his for a flitting instant; then the
dealer made a sign to his substitute and got up from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
place, saying quietly to Philip: “I’ve been expecting
you. We’ll go up-stairs.”</p>

<p>Wholly speechless, Philip followed his father into the
hall, up a stairway and into a room on the third floor
where a gas jet, turned low, was burning. John Trask
reached up and turned the gas on full.</p>

<p>“Might as well sit down,” he said to his son; and
Philip sank into a chair and fought for speech. But
the words would not come. The crushing silence was
broken at length by the father.</p>

<p>“You’ve been looking for me?”</p>

<p>Philip nodded and moistened his dry lips to say,
“Everywhere.”</p>

<p>“I thought most likely you might—after I saw your
name in the papers as one of the ‘lucky-strikers.’”
Then: “You knew me—without the beard?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Philip dully. “You look just the
same, only older.”</p>

<p>“I am older; a good deal older than the six years
will account for. Tell me about your mother and
sisters: you hear from them, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“They are well—and well provided for, now.”</p>

<p>“I suppose they have given me up for dead, haven’t
they?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I only know that I hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it would have been better if you had.”</p>

<p>“No!” Philip broke in desperately. “There is something
for you to do—a thing I can help you do, now
that I have money.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“To go back to New Hampshire with me and fight
those liars, who said you stole from the bank, to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
finish in the courts; to make the Trask name once
more what it has always been—an honest one. I’ll
back you, to the last dollar there is in my half of the
mine.”</p>

<p>The thin lips of the older man parted in the ghost
of a smile.</p>

<p>“Spoken like a good son—or at least a dutiful one,”
he said, in a tone that seemed slightly acid. “But why
be so anxious about the name?”</p>

<p>“Why?—why?” Philip demanded. “Why shouldn’t
I be anxious about it? Isn’t it the name I bear?”</p>

<p>“A name is nothing unless you make it something—but
we won’t argue about that. You say you want me
to go back to New Hampshire and set things right.
It hasn’t occurred to you that there might be a certain
difficulty in the way?”</p>

<p>“You mean the fact that you didn’t stay and fight
it out at the time?”</p>

<p>The ghost of a smile came again.</p>

<p>“No; I didn’t mean that. I mean the fact that not
all of your money could help me to prove what isn’t
so. I took the money from the bank; stole it, you’ll
say, though I chose to call it squaring accounts with
Hiram Witherspoon, who had kept me on starvation
wages for years. I took it and got away with it.”</p>

<p>Once again Philip’s heart skipped a beat and stopped,
and for a moment the room whirled in dizzying circles
for him.</p>

<p>“You—you stole it?” he faltered, in a voice that he
scarcely recognized as his own. Then, helplessly: “I—I
don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t,” was the curt reply, “you are too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
much of a Sanborn. They never kick over the traces.”
A pause, and then: “You’d never understand in a
month of Sundays, Phil. Your grandfather was a hard
man and a hypocrite. He never took his hand off my
collar until after I was a man grown—bull-necked me
into everything I ever did, even to my marriage with
your mother, forgetting that I had the same blood in
me that he had in him. He lived a double life until he
died, and thought nobody knew; but I knew, and I did
the same until the time came when I could help myself
and bolt—with the other woman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!” Philip groaned, and covered his face
with his hands to shut out the sight of the man who
sat opposite, calmly indifferent, as it seemed, to the
havoc he had wrought.</p>

<p>When Philip looked up it was to say harshly:
“Where is the other woman now?”</p>

<p>“She is here—in Denver. She does a turn now and
then at the Corinthian when the cards run queer for
me.”</p>

<p>Philip staggered to his feet in a desolate rage.</p>

<p>“Then I’m the son of a thief, a gambler and the
paramour of a kept woman!” he blazed out madly.
“That’s the name I bear, is it?—the reward I get for
believing in you, like the damned fool that I was, when
everybody else was against you?” He shook his fist
in his father’s face. “Do you know what you’ve done
to me? You’ve killed my soul—that’s what you’ve
done!—blasted my faith in all humankind! Let me get
out of here, before I—Oh, God!...”</p>

<p>He choked and clapped his hands to his face, stumbling
toward the door. As he fumbled for the knob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
and twisted it, the chill voice behind him said: “You
had no call to chase me, and you needn’t worry about
the name. I haven’t called myself John Trask since
I left New Hampshire. And one thing more: I’ve
put a bullet through a man before this for saying less
than you said a minute ago. That’s all, I guess.”</p>

<p>Philip groped his way through the upper passage and
down the two flights of stairs to the sidewalk. The
reaction from the fit of mad rage set in as he stepped
into the open air and he went suddenly weak and
nauseated. The Tabor Building was just opposite,
and in the alley beside it he saw the light of the saloon
at the back. Two minutes later he had staggered
across the street, up the alley and into the lighted bar-room,
which proved to be momentarily empty of other
patrons. “Whiskey!” he gasped, leaning against the
bar. “I’m sick!”</p>

<p>The bartender set out the bottle and a glass of water,
and spun the empty whiskey glass along the polished
mahogany. With a hand that was shaking as if with
palsy, Philip tilted the bottle, poured himself a drink
that ignored the miniature pig etched in the side of the
glass with the motto, “Don’t drown the hog,” and
gulped it down. The neat liquor was like a draft of
liquid fire to his unaccustomed palate and throat, and
he choked and strangled until the bartender reached
over and put the glass of water into his hand with a
grinning comment: “Guess you hain’t got the knack
yet o’ takin’ it straight, son. Wash ’er down with a
chaser o’ water.”</p>

<p>With his throat still afire, Philip took to the streets.
Since the huge drink he had just swallowed was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
first he had ever taken, its intoxicating effect was
almost instantaneous. Before he had walked half a
dozen blocks his brain was spinning and he fancied
he was treading upon thin air. From that time on,
consciousness faded little by little; all he knew was
that he was walking, walking endlessly, sometimes
through streets that seemed dimly familiar, at other
times with all the surroundings singularly strange.</p>

<p>Finally he found himself climbing what he took to
be the steps of the Alamo Building to his rooms,
drenched and permeated now with an overpowering
desire to sleep. In some odd way the steps did not
seem quite right; there were not enough of them. And
there was a lighted door at the top which was opened
for him before he could reach for the knob. It was
at this conjuncture that reasoning consciousness forsook
him completely. He had a vague impression that
somebody—Bromley it would be, of course,—was
leading him somewhere; that his feet, from being so
lately shod with wings, had become unaccountably
leaden; that there were more steps to be climbed; and
after that, the oblivion of a sleep profound and trance-like.</p>

<p>When he awoke he found himself lying, fully
clothed, upon a bed in a strange room. The window
shades were drawn, but the morning sun was shining
upon them. On the edge of the bed, with her single
garment slipping over one shoulder, sat a girl with
carmined lips and pencilled eyebrows; she was laughing
at him and saying: “Had a good sleep, honey?”
adding: “You certainly had a lovely jag on last night
when you turned up here. Did somebody dope you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>Philip leaped up and slewed himself around to sit
beside the strange girl. The quick movement set a
trip-hammer pounding in his head, and he had to wince
and press his temples and wait a minute before he
could master the throbbing pain and say, “Where
am I?”</p>

<p>“As if you didn’t know!” she gibed. “You sure
had a skinful, but I guess you still knew enough to
come where you’d be took care of. Here’s your
pocketbook. Wonder somebody didn’t nip it off you
before you got here.”</p>

<p>Slowly he began to realize where he was.</p>

<p>“Are you trying to tell me that I’ve been here all
night, with you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; not with me; not any; just with yourself.
A cannon wouldn’t ’ve waked you after we got you
up-stairs.”</p>

<p>“What made you take me in?”</p>

<p>The girl laughed again and pointed at the pocketbook
in his hands.</p>

<p>“That, and your good clothes. The madam said she
knew you wasn’t no dead-beat.”</p>

<p>Soberly he took a bank-note from the well-stuffed
pocketbook and gave it to her.</p>

<p>“Is that enough?” he asked. “I’m new to this sort
of thing.”</p>

<p>The girl flung her arms around his neck and kissed
him.</p>

<p>“You’re a dandy—a prince!” she said; and as he
staggered to his feet and reached for his hat: “Have
you got to go, right away? If you’ll wait, I’ll dig
you up a cup of coffee for a bracer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“No; I’ll go.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll show you the way out. There ain’t
nobody else up in the house yet. It’s early.”</p>

<p>She ran down the stair ahead of him and snapped
the night latch on the front door to let him out. As
he passed her she patted him softly on the shoulder.
“Good-by, honey, dear. You’ll come back again,
won’t you? And next time, for Pete’s sake, don’t get
so parboiled that you won’t know me.”</p>

<p>When he reached the sidewalk he turned to look back
at the place. He knew the house. It was one that
Middleton had pointed out to him a year in the past
as one of the few places of the sort where, as the fat-faced
tonnage clerk had phrased it, “a man needn’t
carry a burglar-proof safe with him to be sure of
finding his wallet when he wakes up in the morning.”</p>

<p>Philip looked at his watch. It had run down and he
swore at it under his breath. The aftermath of the
single gluttonous drink was still with him in the shape
of a parched throat, a dry tongue, a fiercely aching head
and a set of jangled nerves. At first, he thought he
would go to his rooms and take a cold bath; but after
he had gone a block or two in that direction he changed
his mind and once more sought the saloon in the rear
of the Tabor Building. The night bartender was still
on duty and he grinned when Philip came in.</p>

<p>“Want a little of the hair o’ the dog that bit you,
I reckon?” he said, setting out the bottle and glasses.</p>

<p>Philip poured a drink, a small one, this time, and
since the mere smell of the liquor gagged him, he held
his nose as he drank. The stimulant steadied the
twittering nerves; and it did more—it cleared his brain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
and brought the desolating revelation of the night back
with a vividness that hurt like the stabbing of needles.
He set his watch by the bar-room clock. As the girl
in the other street had said, it was quite early. Bromley
would not be up yet. Suddenly it came to him that he
could not face Bromley; not yet, at any rate. He must
eat breakfast first; and he went around to Charpiot’s
for the meal.</p>

<p>The breakfast, a light one, for his stomach was still
in revolt, was hastily despatched; and as he was leaving
the table the play-boy came in.</p>

<p>“Hello, there!” he exclaimed. “You are still in
town? I looked into your room and saw your bed
hadn’t been slept in, so I concluded you’d taken a
night train to somewhere.”</p>

<p>“No,” Philip replied soberly; “I haven’t been out of
town.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t rush off. Sit down and be neighborly
while I get a bite of breakfast.”</p>

<p>“No,” Philip repeated, “I’ve got to go.” Then he
turned back and forced himself to look his partner in
the eyes. “That matter we were talking about last
night before you went to the theater: I’m not going to
take that room at the Dabneys’. You are the one to
go there.”</p>

<p>The play-boy looked his surprise.</p>

<p>“Why—what’s the matter with you, Phil? When I
spoke of it last night, I thought you looked tickled
purple.”</p>

<p>“Last night was last night, and this morning is another
day. Say that I don’t care to give up the stuffy
luxuries of the apartment in the Alamo, if you like.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
Anyway, I’m not going to move; that is all there is
to it.”</p>

<p>And with this curt refusal he turned his back upon
his partner and left the dining-room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Passing</span> out through the hotel office with one
thought effacing all others, namely, that companionship
of any sort was not to be endured, Philip, a prey
to the instinctive urge that drives the wounded animal
to seek a hiding place, pulled his hat over his eyes,
signalled to a passing cab and got in, telling the driver
to take him to the Alamo Building.</p>

<p>Reaching his rooms, he scribbled a note for Bromley,
merely saying that he was going out of town, filled a
travelling-bag, jamming things into it with little regard
for long-established habits of care and orderliness, and
was presently on his way to the Union Depot, urging
the cab driver to haste and still more haste. By a
margin of seconds he caught the South Park train for
Leadville; and as the short string of top-heavy,
narrow-gauge cars went swaying and lurching out
over the switches in the West Denver yard, he was
choosing an isolated seat in the chair-car where he could
settle himself to look the catastrophic revelation of the
night fairly in the face.</p>

<p>With the scene of the revelation actually withdrawing
into the distance, a vast incredulity seized him.
Could it be possible that he had grown up in daily
association with his father without so much as suspecting
the existence of the iron-hard, desperate underman
biding its time beneath an exterior so like that of other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
men in his walk of life as to be wholly unremarkable?
It seemed fantastically unbelievable. Yet, in looking
back upon the conventional New England home life
he saw how it might be so.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the home, as he had always known
it, had been one of silent restraint, and there had been
nothing like man-to-man comradeship between his
father and himself. Not that this was at all singular.
He had known many other households in the homeland
in which the same spirit of reticence and aloofness,
the same repression of all the emotions, were
the natural order of things. The attitude was ingrained
in the bone and blood; a heritage which, as he
now realized, was his and his forebears’; the bequeathing
of the stern stock which had fled from tyranny in
England only to set up a repressive tyranny of its own
in the new land beyond the sea.</p>

<p>But such reflections as these did not serve to lessen
the completeness, the crushing completeness, of the
blow that had fallen. Where was now that righteous
pride of race he had paraded before Jean Dabney, the
boast of honest and upright ancestors he had so confidently
made?—he, the son of a thief, a gambler, a
hardened breaker of the laws of God and man. Of
what use to him now was the growing hoard of gold in
the Denver bank, since it could never buy back that
which was irretrievably lost? How could he go on
living from day to day with the knowledge that the
accident of any day might give some sensation-mongering
newspaper reporter the chance to write up
Lucky-strike Trask of the “Little Jean” as the son of
a well-known local faro-dealer and sporting man? In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
his mind’s eye he could visualize the mocking headlines,
and a wave of impotent rage, the agony of a tortured
ego, swept over him.</p>

<p>He had no desire to eat when the train halted at
the midday dinner station and did not leave his place in
the chair-car. Later, through the long afternoon, he
looked out, with eyes that saw without perceiving, upon
the passing panorama of canyon cliffs and forested
mountain slopes, of undulating distances in the South
Park and the uplifted peaks of the Mosquito Range,
deep in the misery of his wounding; aghast at the
prospect of the future. It was with an added degree
of wretchedness that he realized that his love for Jean
Dabney, restrained and calmly calculated hitherto,
seemed to have been set free in the chaotic crash of
things, blazing up in passionate intensity now that its
object was, as he told himself bitterly, snatched out of
reach. That he could never go to her with the story
of his humiliating discovery was the first sickening
conclusion that had burned itself into his consciousness;
and now this was followed by the appalling after-conclusion
that he could not go to her at all; that the
discovery in the gambling hell had cut him off at once
and irrevocably from all association with her.</p>

<p>It was only natural that the thought of his own
lapse, the fact that he had taken his first drink and in
the drunkenness of it had spent the night in a brothel,
seemed of small account in the general wreck. With
the family honor already dragged so deeply in the mire
of disgrace and criminality, what he might or might
not do made little difference one way or the other.
Not that he cherished as yet any desperate or boyish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
determination to take a fool’s revenge by plunging into
dissipation. There was only a dull indifference.
Pride was dead and the barriers of self-control had
been broken down, but life still had to be lived, in
some fashion.</p>

<p>Upon arriving in Leadville he had himself driven to
the hotel where he and Bromley had put up after they
had come out of the mountains with Drew in the
spring. Still having no desire to eat, he tried to smoke;
and when the pipe, on an empty stomach, nauseated
him, he went to the bar and called for a drink. As in
the morning, the swallow or two of whiskey wrought
a miracle and he sought the dining-room and ate a
hearty meal. Afterward, with a mild cigar that had
none of the dizzying effects of the empty-stomach pipe,
he sat in the lobby, and it was there that Drew ran
across him.</p>

<p>“Back with us again, are you?” was the genial promoter’s
greeting as he drew up a chair and planted
himself in it for his own after-dinner smoke. “When
did you reach?”</p>

<p>“Just an hour or so ago,” Philip answered, surprised
to find himself able to tolerate and even to welcome the
companionship of the older man. “I came up on the
South Park day train.”</p>

<p>“And how is Henry Wigglesworth? Still making a
quiet joke of the world at large?”</p>

<p>“Harry is all right. Good luck hasn’t spoiled him,
as I was afraid it might.”</p>

<p>“Inclined to be a little wild, was he?” Drew
remarked.</p>

<p>“When I first met him, yes. And I was foolish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
enough to think that I had to brother him. Queer
what notions a man gets into his head, sometimes.”</p>

<p>Though he did not look aside, he knew that Drew
was regarding him curiously.</p>

<p>“You come of brothering stock, don’t you, Trask?”</p>

<p>“At one time I was ass enough to think so. That
was another of the queer notions. How is the ‘Little
Jean’ coming along?”</p>

<p>“Splendidly. The vein values are increasing as we
drive in on the lode. We are making another clean-up
from the plates this week, and you’ll get a dividend
that will warm the cockles of your heart.”</p>

<p>“Money,” said Philip half contemptuously. “When
you don’t have it, it’s the most desirable thing in the
world. And when you get it——” he broke off, leaving
the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>The promoter smiled. “Money is only a means to
an end, of course. If it is not too personal a question,
what are you doing with yours?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, as yet. Bromley is investing his share
here and there, setting me a good example. But I
haven’t followed it.”</p>

<p>From that the talk went back to the gulch on the
western slope, and Drew told how the shut-in valley
had been overrun by prospectors as soon as the snow
was off. A few small leads had been discovered
higher up the gulch, but nothing at all comparable
with the “Little Jean.” Reference to the hard winter
the discoverers of the “Little Jean” had put in led
Drew to ask about Garth; and the mention of the big
miner’s name stabbingly reminded Philip of the chance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
incident in which Garth had figured, and which had led
up to the blotting out of all recollection of him.</p>

<p>“Garth is in Denver; or he was yesterday,” he
replied.</p>

<p>“Pity about Jim,” said the promoter. “At bottom
he’s a man, right; but he can’t let liquor and the paste-boards
alone. He has been moderately well-fixed at
least three times, to my certain knowledge, and each
time he has blown it all; gambled it and given it away—or
so much of it as he didn’t pass across the bar.”</p>

<p>Philip was conscious of a curious little shock when
he realized that this cataloguing of Garth’s weaknesses
now stirred no resentful or condemnatory emotion in
him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps that is the way in which he gets the most
out of life,” he offered colorlessly. “There is no accounting
for the difference in tastes.”</p>

<p>“No; but Big Jim is really worth saving, if somebody
would take the trouble,” Drew put in, adding:
“I don’t suppose anybody has ever cared enough for
him to try to brace him up—at least, nobody since his
wife died.”</p>

<p>“He was married?” Philip queried. “I worked beside
him all winter and never knew that.”</p>

<p>“It was one of those cases you read about—and
seldom see in real life,” Drew went on reminiscently.
“It happened in one of the intervals when Jim was on
top, financially. A gambler, whose name I have forgotten,
brought a girl here from the East—a ‘chippy,’
I suppose you’d call her—abused her shamefully, made
her support him for a time and then abandoned her.
Jim heard about it, and after marrying the girl off-hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
hunted up the gambler and shot him within an
inch of his life. The girl turned out to be a jewel as
Jim’s wife; stuck to him through thick and thin, and
actually got him to stop drinking and gambling. Then
the altitude, and the hard life she had lived before she
met Jim, grabbed her and she died. Naturally, poor
old Jim went all to pieces again.”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” Philip agreed. His eyes were narrowed
and he was conscious of a curious deadening of the
heart. The story of Garth’s tragedy did not move him
as it would have moved him no longer ago than yesterday.
Instead, he was asking himself why Garth
shouldn’t take to drink and dissipation to drown his
grief? For that matter, why shouldn’t any man, if
he happened to lean that way?</p>

<p>Drew looked at his watch and rose.</p>

<p>“I have an appointment that I was about to forget,”
he said. “Intending to stop over with us for a
while?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. I haven’t made any plans.”</p>

<p>“All right; we’ll get together again. While you are
here, my office is at your disposal, of course. Come
around and make it your loafing place.”</p>

<p>After Drew had left him, Philip lighted another of
the mild cigars and took to the streets, walking until he
was sodden with weariness. Again and again the
meager details of Garth’s tragedy passed themselves
in review. So the big miner had once made his little
gesture of righteousness by marrying a woman of the
class for which the world has no place of repentance,
had he? That was fine! How crassly he had misjudged
Garth. Bromley’s insight had been better.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
Was the play-boy’s assumption that there was no hard-and-fast
line to be drawn between the sheep and the
goats—that there was good in the worst and bad in the
best—the right one, after all?</p>

<p>Philip’s thoughts went back to the scene of the early
morning when he had awakened to find a girl with pencilled
eyebrows and painted lips sitting on the edge of
his bed in the strange room. “Scum of the earth,” he
had been calling her and her kind; and yet she, and her
still more degraded house mistress, had taken him in
and cared for him, and had not robbed him and turned
him helpless into the street, as they might have done.
He had a vivid picture of the girl sitting there and
laughing at him as he opened his eyes. She was pretty,
in a way, and her talk and manner had given him the
impression of recklessness and misguiding rather than
hardness. Was she one of these who are more sinned
against than sinning? He wondered.</p>

<p>Tired out finally, he returned to the hotel and went
to bed. In the life which was already withdrawing into
a far-away past he had always been able to fall asleep
as soon as his head touched the pillow; but now,
though it was past midnight and he was weary to utter
exhaustion, sleep would not come. Over and over the
harrowing details of the discovery of his father and
the scene in the upper room over the gambling den
rehearsed themselves as he tossed and tumbled and
tried to banish them; and at last, in sheer desperation,
he got up and dressed and went down to the lobby
floor. The bar-room was closed, and he appealed to
the night clerk, money in hand.</p>

<p>“I’m sick and can’t sleep,” he said. “Couldn’t you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
break in back there and get me a drink? I don’t want
to take to the streets at this time of night.”</p>

<p>The clerk smiled knowingly. “Got a hang-over,
have you? I guess I can fix you.” He disappeared,
to return presently with a pint bottle of whiskey.
“Think that will do the business for you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; thanks. Don’t bother about the change.”</p>

<p>Once more in his room, he slipped out of his clothes,
took a stiff drink, and stretched himself upon the bed.
In a little time the curious and altogether pleasant feeling
of levitation came and he floated off through a
spacious region of dreams which grew vaguer and
vaguer until they vanished in an abyss of forgetfulness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bromley</span> had been occupying the spare bed-room in
the Dabney cottage for nearly a fortnight on the
Saturday when, calling at the Windsor Hotel to tell
the Follansbees about a bargain in furnished houses
he had happened to hear of, he saw Stephen Drew
registering in at the room clerk’s desk and crossed the
lobby to shake hands with him.</p>

<p>“This is a piece of luck,” said the lessee of the
“Little Jean,” after the greetings were passed. “I
didn’t know your address and was expecting to have
to dig you up through the bank or the post-office. I
came down on business, but also I was anxious to get
hold of you. If you have a few minutes to spare——?”</p>

<p>“All the time there is,” returned the play-boy cheerfully,
leading the way to a couple of the lobby chairs.
Then, with a laugh: “I hope you are not going to tell
me the ‘Little Jean’ is petering out.”</p>

<p>“Nothing like that. The mine is all right. The
values are increasing, as your next dividend will show.
I wanted to talk to you about Trask. Do you know
where he is?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the remotest idea. He dropped out between
two minutes one morning early last week, leaving
a note which merely said that he was vanishing.
It’s all right, though. He has been making a good
many swings around the circle in the past month or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
so, on a sort of still hunt for his—for a man he is
trying to find.”</p>

<p>“Did you see him before he left Denver this last
time?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes; I was with him the evening before he
left; and I saw him, for just a minute or two, the next
morning.”</p>

<p>“Anything wrong with him then?”</p>

<p>Bromley took time to think back. Previous to that
brittle meeting in the breakfast-room at Charpiot’s,
Philip had been out, somewhere, all night. Now that
he recalled it, he remembered that the meeting had
been only momentary; that Philip had looked rather
the worse for wear; that his refusal to take the spare
room in the Dabney cottage had been almost brutal in
its abruptness.</p>

<p>“I can’t say there was anything definitely wrong,”
he replied. “I remember he looked a bit gloomy and
wrought up, but that is nothing new for him. He has
pretty bad attacks of the New England conscience at
times—if you know what that means.”</p>

<p>Drew nodded. “I understand. But that isn’t to
the point just now. Your partner is in Leadville, and
he is badly in need of a friend; somebody near enough
and intimate enough to take him by the neck.”</p>

<p>Bromley laughed easily.</p>

<p>“There must be some mistake about that. Philip,
himself, is the one who rushes around taking people
by the neck.”</p>

<p>“You are off wrong, this time,” the promoter cut
in shortly. “I don’t believe he has been entirely sober
at any one time during the past two weeks, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
seems to be permeated with an idea that he can use
up all the red paint there is and break all the gambling
banks in the camp if he only sticks at it long enough.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” Bromley gasped; “not <i>Philip</i>!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Philip. Of course, I understand that it’s
none of my business, but I hate to see such a fine, upstanding
fellow as he is go to the devil in a hand-basket.
Has he had trouble of any sort?”</p>

<p>Bromley took a moment to consider whether or not
he had a right to breach Philip’s confidence in the
matter of the search for his father, and decided
quickly that the present crisis warranted it. Very
briefly he told Drew the little he knew about the Trask
family tragedy, and of the futile search Philip had
been making.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the shrewd-witted developer of mines,
“that may be the clue. You say Philip believed in his
father’s innocence?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely and utterly. But from what he has told
me, I gathered that he was pretty much alone in that
belief; that, as a matter of fact, not even the other
members of the family shared it.”</p>

<p>“I see. Then that may be the key to the present
situation. Trask is pretty sensitive on the family
honor question, and all that, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Exceedingly so. It, and his conscience, are his
little tin gods.”</p>

<p>“There you are, then. You say his search for his
father has been futile. You don’t know positively that
it was, do you?”</p>

<p>“It was, up to the night before he went to Leadville.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“Well, many a man has had his world turned upside
down for him between dark and daylight in a single
night. Whatever the cause may have been, the effects
are as I have indicated. Philip is setting a pace that
not even a half-share in a gold mine can stand indefinitely.
If you think you can do anything with him,
you’d better go after him. As I say, he is needing a
friend mighty badly.”</p>

<p>“Sure I’ll go,” agreed the play-boy promptly. “I
owe Philip a lot more than I’ll ever be able to pay.
And you mustn’t judge him by this one fall-down,
Mr. Drew. There are some people who suffer most
from an excess of their virtues—if you know what I
mean—and Philip is one of those. He has stood up
stiff and straight all his life, and when a fellow who
lives that way gets bowled over——”</p>

<p>“I know,” assented the man of large experience.
“The greatest danger in a case of that kind lies in that
‘excess of the virtues’ you speak of. When the barriers
are once thrown down, the job of rebuilding them
is apt to seem hopeless.”</p>

<p>“That is where it will hit Phil the hardest, I’m sure.
But we won’t hope for the worst. Are you stopping
over for a few days?”</p>

<p>“Until Monday or Tuesday. Are your quarters here
in the Windsor?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I have a boarding place in West Denver—with
friends. I’m here just now to call upon some
other friends—people from Philadelphia. And that
reminds me: you said you used to live in Philadelphia;
perhaps you know these friends of mine—the Follansbees?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“Not Judge John?”</p>

<p>“You have called the turn; Judge John and Mrs.
Judge John and Tom and Eugenia and Lucy Ann.”</p>

<p>“You don’t tell me! I know the judge and his wife
very well, indeed; and the children, too, though they
were only children in my time. You say they are
here, in the hotel?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Wait a minute and I’ll carry the word to
them.”</p>

<p>He was gone only a short time, and when he returned
to the lobby, the judge and Mrs. Follansbee
came with him. He stood aside while the three were
happily bridging the gap of the years, and at the first
lull he broke in smoothly to say to Drew: “Mrs. Follansbee
has been good enough to include me in a dinner
party for this evening, and I have just told her that I
am unexpectedly obliged to leave town, but I was quite
sure you would be willing to substitute for me.”</p>

<p>“Of course you will, Stephen,” put in the lady
patroness, surveying the stocky figure of the promoter
through her lorgnette; then, with a sigh for the vanished
years: “My, my; what a man you’ve grown to
be! I should never have known you, with that clipped
beard and the eyeglasses. Can’t you spare a few
minutes to come up to our suite and see Eugenia and
Lucy Ann? They both remember you.”</p>

<p>Bromley glanced at his watch and slipped away. He
had promised to take Jean Dabney to luncheon, and
there was barely time to reach Madame Marchande’s
place in Sixteenth Street by the appointed noon hour.
When he did reach the millinery shop he found Jean
waiting on the sidewalk for him, and he took her to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
new chop house lately opened in the block next to the
St. James, steering clear of the subject that was uppermost
in his mind until after they were seated in one of
the box-like private stalls and their order had been
given and served. Then he began without preface.</p>

<p>“I want to ask you something about Philip, Jean.
He walked home with you a week ago last Monday
evening, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Let me think,” she answered reflectively. “To-day
is Saturday; yes, it was a week ago Monday.”</p>

<p>“Did he—did he act as though he was especially
troubled about anything?”</p>

<p>“Why, no; not that I saw. I remember he scolded
me a little because he seemed to think I wasn’t quite
as savagely righteous as I ought to be. But he has
done that lots of times. He walks so straight himself
that he can’t bear to see anybody lean over, ever so
little.”</p>

<p>Bromley winced. If Drew’s story were true—and
there was no reason to doubt it—Philip was not walking
straight now; he was grovelling. What would Jean
say if she knew? He had not meant to tell her what
he had just heard; did not yet mean to tell her. Still,
she would have to know, some time. If he could only
be sure that the knowledge wouldn’t smash her....
He would have to feel his way carefully.</p>

<p>“I am wondering if Philip ever told you anything
about his father,” he said; and he tried to say it
casually.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; he has told me all there was to tell, I
think: how his father went away under a—under a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
cloud, and how he has been searching for him out here.
Was that what you meant?”</p>

<p>Bromley nodded. There was nothing in her tone or
manner to lead him to believe that she had anything
more than a friendly interest in Philip’s problem, and
he went on.</p>

<p>“He has been away for two weeks, or nearly two
weeks. He left town the next morning after he walked
home with you that Monday evening. He didn’t tell
me where he was going. Did he tell you?”</p>

<p>“He said he might go to the camps down in the
San Juan next. But he didn’t say anything about going
so soon. Haven’t you heard from him since that
time?”</p>

<p>“No; he hasn’t written me,” Bromley hastened to
say, telling a half-truth which was little short of a lie
direct.</p>

<p>“But you are not anxious about him, are you?”</p>

<p>“Anxious? Why should I be?”</p>

<p>“But I think you are,” she said, looking him fairly
in the eyes.</p>

<p>As upon certain other occasions, he tried hard to
plumb the depths of the dark eyes that were lifted to
his, striving to read the answer to a question that had
been tormenting him ever since his first meeting with
her. How much did she care for Philip? Was she
as much in love with him as he was with her? If she
were, this was neither the time nor the place for the
repeating of Drew’s story. But if she were not ...
he made up his mind suddenly and took the plunge.</p>

<p>“Jean, you know you can trust me to the limit, don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
you? Tell me honestly what there is between you and
Philip.”</p>

<p>“What there is between us?” The steady gaze of
the dark eyes did not waver. “We are friends, of
course; good friends, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Nothing more?”</p>

<p>“What more could there be?”</p>

<p>“Then I may talk to you just as I might to any other
friend of his?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why you shouldn’t.” Tone and manner
both gave him the assurance that he might go on;
that there was nothing more vital to be wounded than
the friendship she had admitted.</p>

<p>“Something has happened to Philip. I lied to you a
minute ago—said I hadn’t heard from Phil. I haven’t,
not directly; but Mr. Drew is down from Leadville,
and he tells me that Philip is up in the big camp, ripping
things wide open. I couldn’t believe it—can hardly
believe it yet.”</p>

<p>The deep-welled eyes were downcast now, and Bromley
held his breath. If there were a little quiver of the
sensitive lips when she spoke, the play-boy missed it—missed
everything but the steady tone of her reply.</p>

<p>“I have been afraid of something like that, haven’t
you? Of course, you know what has happened?”</p>

<p>“I don’t—I can’t imagine!”</p>

<p>“It is perfectly plain. He has found his father.”</p>

<p>“You think that is it?”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it.”</p>

<p>“But, even so—” he began.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see? He hasn’t—he didn’t find things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
as he hoped to find them. Don’t you know him well
enough to know what that would do to him?”</p>

<p>It was said coolly enough, almost coldly; and Bromley
marvelled. He had never imagined she could be so
dispassionate. Before he could pull himself around
to some half-way adequate matching of her mood, she
went on:</p>

<p>“Philip has always walked in a very narrow and
straight path for himself, and he is very proud, in his
own way. If something has happened to break his
pride.... I know that is what <i>has</i> happened; I am
sure of it.”</p>

<p>The play-boy drew a deep breath. The worst was
over, and it wasn’t nearly as bad as he had feared it
would be. Either she didn’t care, any more than a
friendly soul should care, or she had more adamantine
self-control than had fallen to the share of any other
woman he had ever known.</p>

<p>“I’m going up after him to-night,” he said. “When
I get him back here you’ll have to help me.”</p>

<p>“Of course—if I can,” she agreed. “But if it is as
I think it is, I’m afraid neither of us will be able to
help him very much.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?”</p>

<p>“Just because he is what he is. Some people have
to be helped; they can’t get up unless they are helped.
But there are others—and Philip is one of them—who
have to fight their way back the best they can, alone.
It’s hard to think of it that way, for a—for a friend.
But it is true.”</p>

<p>Bromley forced himself to smile.</p>

<p>“You are a very wise little woman, much wiser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
than your years call for. But see here—you’re not
eating enough to keep a kitten alive. How do you
expect to be able to work if you don’t eat?”</p>

<p>“I’m not as hungry as I thought I was. It’s the
hot weather, maybe.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you eat another cream puff if I should
order it?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you. Besides, my time is up. I know it
isn’t nice to eat and run, but if you <i>will</i> invite a working
girl out to luncheon, you’ll have to take the consequences.”</p>

<p>He walked back to the door of the millinery shop
with her and at the moment of parting she said, “You’ll
be gentle with Philip when you find him, won’t you?
It won’t do any good to be the other way.”</p>

<p>“I shall take him by the neck,” he threatened good-naturedly,
adding: “He’s old enough and man enough
to have better sense.” Then: “I’m going to be fearfully
busy this afternoon. Do you suppose Mysie
could pack my grip for me if I should send a messenger
after it with a note?”</p>

<p>“Mysie would be dreadfully humbled if she could
hear you ask such a thing as that,” she smiled. “She
isn’t the child you seem to persist in believing her to
be. She will be sixteen in a few days. How long do
you think you will be away?”</p>

<p>“Heaven knows; no longer than I can help, you
may be sure. Good-by; take care of yourself, and
don’t work too hard. If you want to do anything
for me while I’m gone, just say a little prayer or two.
It runs in my mind that I may need all the help I can
get. Good-by.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>Having become, in a desultory way, a working
capitalist, or at least an investing one, Bromley had a
number of business matters to be despatched before he
could leave town for an indefinite stay. None the less,
out of a well-filled afternoon he clipped time enough
to go around to the Colorado National Bank where
Philip kept his account. Since he was known in the
bank as Philip’s partner, he had no difficulty in finding
out what he wished to learn. Philip had been drawing
heavily on his checking account during the two weeks,
and the drafts had all come through Leadville banks.
Bromley asked for the approximate figure and gasped
when he was told that the recent withdrawals totalled
something over twenty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Quartered in the sleeper for the night run to Leadville,
Bromley, generously distressed, was still groping
for some reasonable solution to the problem presented
by Philip’s wild splash into the sea of dissipation—a
plunge so wholly out of keeping with his character.
Was Jean’s guess that he had found his father, and
that the discovery had proved to be a calamity instead
of a cause for rejoicing, the right one? If not, what
other upsetting thing could have happened between
half-past seven in the Monday evening, when he had
left Philip in their common sitting-room in the Alamo
Building, and the next morning when he had met him
leaving the breakfast-table in Charpiot’s? Where had
Philip spent the night? And what had occurred during
those few unaccounted-for hours to put a look of
morbid gloom in his eyes and to make him refuse,
almost savagely, to become an inmate of the West
Denver cottage?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“He’d had a knock-down fight of some sort with that
strait-laced conscience of his, I suppose, and it must
have been a bloody one to make him let go all holds
like this,” the play-boy told himself, balancing on the
edge of the made-down berth to take off his shoes as the
train began its swaying, wheel-shrilling climb in the
snake-like sinuosities of Platte Canyon. Then, as he
drew the curtains and essayed the irritating task of
undressing in the dark, cramped berth, with the car
careening to right and left like a ship at sea: “He’ll
find it bad medicine and bitter; but if it will only end
by making a normal human man of him....”</p>

<p>It was deep in the night, and the train was halted
at a mountain-side station, when Bromley awoke,
shivering in the chill of the high altitude, and sat up
to reach for the extra blanket at the foot of the berth.
As he did so, a thunderous murmur in the air announced
the approach of the Denver-bound train for
which his own was side-tracked, and he ran a window
shade up to look out just as the eastbound train, with its
miniature locomotive and short string of cars, coasted
down, with brake-shoes grinding, to the meeting-point
stop.</p>

<p>Reflecting upon it afterward, he thought it a most
curious coincidence that the night chill should have
awakened him just at this time, and that the momentary
stop of the opposing train should place the one pair
of lighted windows in its single Pullman opposite his
own darkened one. While one might have counted
ten he sat staring, wide-eyed, across the little space
separating the two standing trains. The lighted windows
opposite were those in the smoking compartment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
of the eastbound sleeper. Around the little table
bracketed between the seats sat three men with cards
in their hands and stacks of red, white and blue counters
before them. Though two of the men were unknown
to the play-boy, he was able instantly to label them as
birds of prey. The third man was Philip; a Philip
so changed and wasted by two weeks of unrestraint as
to be scarcely recognizable.</p>

<p>As Bromley looked he saw one of the birds of prey
pass a flat pocket bottle across the table; and his final
glimpse through the lighted window as the down train
slid away showed him Philip with his head thrown
back and the tilted bottle at his lips.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” groaned the play-boy, falling back
upon his pillows, “Drew didn’t stretch it an inch!
Those two blacklegs will strip Phil to the skin before
they let go of him and before they will let him get
sober enough to realize what they’re doing to him!
And I’ve got to go through to Leadville and come all
the way back before I can get a chance to stick my
oar in!” At the word the westbound train began to
move, and he pulled the blankets up to his ears, muttering
again: “There’s only one ray of comfort in
the whole desperate business, and that is that Jean
isn’t going to break her heart over this diabolic blow-up
of Philip’s. I’m glad I took the trouble to make
sure of that, anyhow.”</p>

<p>But if, at this precise moment of midnight, he could
have looked into the bed-room next to his own in the
West Denver cottage, the room occupied by Jean and
her sister Mysie, the comforting reflection might have
lost something of its force. The younger sister was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
sleeping peacefully, but the elder had slipped quietly out
of bed to kneel at the open, westward-fronting window
with her shoulders shaking and her face buried in the
crook of a bare white arm.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">XIX</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> Bromley, swiftly changing from the up to
the down train on the Sunday morning arrival in Leadville,
should have won back to Denver at six o’clock
Sunday evening, a freight wreck on the Kenosha
Mountain grade held him up, and it was between nine
and ten when, tired as he was by more than twenty-four
hours of mountain railroad travel, he set out in search
of Philip, making the rooms of the Alamo Building his
starting point.</p>

<p>To his relief, the lighted transom assured him that
the sitting-room was occupied; and when there was
no answer to his knock, he opened the door noiselessly
and entered. At first he thought the hunched figure
in the hollowed-out easy chair beside the reading table
was in a drunken stupor; but when he drew nearer he
saw that the fancied stupor was merely a deep sleep
of exhaustion. Silently placing a chair for himself
on the other side of the table, he lighted his pipe and
waited. After a time the sleeper in the hollowed chair
stirred, stretched his arms over his head, and, at the
smell of live tobacco smoke, opened his eyes and sat
up with a jerk.</p>

<p>“You?” he muttered, blinking across the table at
the play-boy.</p>

<p>“It’s nobody else. Had a good nap?”</p>

<p>Philip’s wordless response was to get up and reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
for a half-emptied bottle standing on a bookcase; but
Bromley stopped him.</p>

<p>“Let that alone, Phil—for the moment, anyway; long
enough to tell me what has hit you. You owe me that
much, at least.”</p>

<p>Philip sank back into the sleepy-hollow chair. “How
much do you know?” he demanded sullenly.</p>

<p>“What Stephen Drew could tell me, added to what I
happened to see at midnight last night when your
train on the South Park met mine at the passing point
in the mountains.”</p>

<p>“You were going to Leadville to hunt me up?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Drew told me you needed to be knocked
down and dragged out.”</p>

<p>Philip’s dull eyes glowed suddenly. “I ought to
have had a gun last night!” he broke out savagely.
“Those two tinhorns robbed me blind!”</p>

<p>“Of course they did. That is what they were out
for. No, wait; I’m not going to preach. I grant you
it’s every man’s privilege to go to the devil in his
own fashion. Still, I’m a trifle curious.”</p>

<p>Silence for the space of a long minute. Then: “You
wouldn’t understand, Harry; I couldn’t make you
understand if I should try. Say that the cursed atmosphere
of this God-forsaken country got hold of me at
last and that I stubbed my toe and fell down. That
will cover it as well as anything.”</p>

<p>“A good many of us fall down, but we get up
again. Have you got to stay down?”</p>

<p>“It looks that way. I haven’t anything to get up
for.”</p>

<p>“Why haven’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“That question runs you up against a shut door,
Harry; a door that I’ll never open for anybody so long
as I can keep it shut. Let that be understood, once
for all.”</p>

<p>“All right; we’ll let it go at that, if you say so.
Just the same——”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Oh, confound it—you know what I want to say,
and can’t Phil! You’ve been more than a brother to
me, ever since you picked me up out of the gutter a
year ago and stood me on my two feet. Can’t you
see where this thing hits me?”</p>

<p>Philip leaned forward, elbows on knees, face propped
in his hands, lead-heavy eyes fixed upon the blank wall
opposite. When he replied, the harshness had gone out
of his voice.</p>

<p>“I can see a great many things now that I have never
been able to see in the past, Harry ... one of them is
that I’ve been a self-blinded Pharisee all my life. All
I needed was a hard enough kick to show me that at
bottom I’m no better than other men; not half as good
or as strong as some other men who make no profession
of their goodness or strength. I got the kick,
finally—no matter how, but I got it—and ... well, I
guess I have found my level. I’ve been in hell for the
last fourteen days and nights, and if I am just beginning
to struggle out, it is at the bottom and not at the
top.”</p>

<p>Bromley was silent for a little time; then he said
huskily: “You’re not going to break with me, Phil?
I couldn’t stand for that, you know. You will have
to go your own way, I suppose; but wherever you go,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
or whatever you do, I’m still your partner. Just remember
that when the pull comes the hardest, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to. But you can’t do anything for me,
Harry; nobody can. I’ve walked deliberately into the
devil’s wood and got lost. If there is any way out—as
there doesn’t seem to be now—I’ve got to find it for
myself. Can you understand that?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can.” Another silence, and then Bromley
went on: “What shall I say to Jean?—or will you
say it to her yourself?”</p>

<p>“You know very well I won’t say it myself. If you
tell her anything you must tell her the plain truth:
that the man she has known as Philip Trask was a
sorry hypocrite; a whited sepulchre, with the cleanliness
all on the outside and full of dead men’s bones within.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that bad, Philip.”</p>

<p>“Yes it is; just that bad. I got my kick, as I have
said, and it was hard enough, God knows. Instead of
taking it like a man, I went under. In a single fortnight
I have measured all the depths—broken all the
moorings. I have shut myself out of the world of
decent people, and I’ve only decency enough left in
me to know that I shall never be able to look a pure
woman in the face again. I have only one comfort
now, Harry, and that is that I have never given Jean
any reason to believe that I was in love with her.”</p>

<p>“You are sure of that, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; quite sure. After the fatuous fashion of the
complete Pharisee I have been holding off, telling myself
that there was plenty of time, that I would wait
until——” he stopped abruptly, and Bromley finished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
the sentence for him, not without an edge in his tone.</p>

<p>“You’d wait until the peach was fully ripe; then
you’d reach up and pluck it.”</p>

<p>“No,” was the sober denial, made with no touch of
resentment. “You must give the devil his due, Harry.
It wasn’t altogether as rotten as that, though maybe
it did lean a little that way, at times. Never mind;
it’s all over now. You have a free field.”</p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I haven’t been blind. Jean is heart-free,
and I saw at once that it was going to lie between us
two. I’m eliminated.”</p>

<p>The edge had gone out of the play-boy’s voice and
there was a faint smile at the bottom of his eyes when
he said: “But, according to the way you stack things
up, I am just as much of a false alarm as you are.
Heaven knows, I’ve waded fully as deep in the mud as
you have in the mire.”</p>

<p>“No; there is a difference. I know it now. Whatever
you have done, you have contrived somehow, in
some way, to keep your soul out of the mud. Flout
the idea if you want to, but I know. I’ve lived with
you for something better than a year and know what
I’m talking about.”</p>

<p>Another interval of silence, and at the end of it
Bromley got upon his feet.</p>

<p>“You are off?” said Philip, without looking up.</p>

<p>“Yes, I must go. I’m train-tired and perishing for
a bath. You’re not meaning to run away from Denver,
are you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I suppose not. There is nowhere to
run to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>At the door Bromley paused with his hand on the
knob.</p>

<p>“Just one other word, Phil—and you may throw
a chair at me if it bites too hard: you’re no gambler.
I mean you can’t hold your own against the crooks
and short-card men.”</p>

<p>“You are right. I have learned my lesson out of
that book this early in the game. Anything else?”</p>

<p>Bromley pointed to the half-empty bottle on the
bookcase.</p>

<p>“That stuff is never much of a friend, and it is always
a pretty bad enemy. I wouldn’t trust it too far,
if I were you. There is always a morning after to
follow the night before.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I have learned that, too. I am learning a
good many things these days. I guess I had it coming
to me. Are you going? Well, good-night.”</p>

<p>After Bromley had gone, Philip heaved himself
wearily out of the deep chair and began to pace the
floor with his head down and his hands locked behind
him. Two weeks of mad, unbridled rebellion against
all the inhibitions had left him weak and shattered in
mind and body. Twice in the circling round of the
room he reached for the bottle on the bookcase, and
once he took it up and started to draw the cork. He
knew that a swallow or two of the liquor would steady
the twittering nerves, temporarily, at least; and that if
he should drink enough of it, he could go to bed and
sleep.</p>

<p>But the good fighting strength which had been his
up to that fatal Monday evening a fortnight in the
past, broken and spent though it was, strove to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
itself felt. Had it already come to this, that he could
no longer go to sleep without first drugging himself
with whiskey? If two short weeks of indulgence had
thus far maimed and crippled him, how long could he
hope to delay the descent into the lowest gutter of
degradation?</p>

<p>“No, by God!” he exclaimed finally. “No more of
it to-night—not if I have to lie awake in hell till daylight!”
And, such is the strength derivable from even
a partial resistance to temptation, he went to bed and
slept the clock around.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XX</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Being</span> gratefully appreciative of a good bed after
a night and a day in a narrow-gauge Pullman, Bromley
slept late on the morning following his return to
Denver; and when he put in an appearance in the
cottage dining-room he found that the family had already
breakfasted and Jean had gone to her work.
Sixteen-year-old Mysie, housewifely and starry-eyed,
was the only member of the household visible, and it
was she who poured his coffee and made the toast.</p>

<p>“Did I disturb you folks when I came in last night?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Jeanie said she heard you; but nothing ever wakes
me. I’m the sleepy-head of the family. Are your eggs
cooked right?”</p>

<p>“How could they be otherwise if you cooked them?”
said the play-boy gallantly. He liked to make Mysie
talk. More than either of her sisters she retained the
soft Southern speech with its submerged “r’s” and
lingering vowels. “Where is Mary Louise this fine
morning?”</p>

<p>“She and Mummie have gone marketing while it
is cool. Shan’t I toast you another slice?”</p>

<p>Bromley let his eyes rest for a moment upon the
fresh, fair young face opposite. The elder of the two
younger girls was a sharp contrast to Jean, whose dark
hair and eyes and warm skin were inheritances from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
her far-away French ancestry. As an artist’s model
Mysie Dabney might have posed for an idealized study
of blushing innocence awakening, of sweet girlhood
poising for the flight into womanhood.</p>

<p>“You spoil me utterly,” he said, smiling into the
wide-open, dewy eyes. Then: “I wonder if you are
old enough to let me ask you a horribly improper
question?”</p>

<p>“Improper? Why, Uncle Harry, I don’t believe you
could be improper if you should try ever so hard!”</p>

<p>Bromley winced at the “Uncle Harry,” though both
of the younger girls had called him that almost from
the beginning.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make a bargain with you,” he said
lightly. “When is your birthday?”</p>

<p>“Next Sunday.”</p>

<p>“All right; there is a pretty birthday gift coming to
you next Sunday if you will promise, after that day,
to stop calling me ‘uncle.’”</p>

<p>The wide-open eyes opened still wider.</p>

<p>“Why—I thought you liked it!”</p>

<p>“I do—from Mary Louise; from little girls generally.
But when you say it, it makes me feel as though
my teeth were coming loose and my hair falling out—old
and decrepit, you know.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d listen!” she laughed. “What do you
want me to call you—after next Sunday?—‘Misteh
Bromley?’”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me, no; that is ever so much worse!
Couldn’t you make it just plain ‘Harry,’ without
the ‘uncle’?”</p>

<p>He saw a faint wave of color rising to the fair neck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
and cheeks, and the down-dropped eyes were no longer
those of a child.</p>

<p>“I—I’ll try,” she promised; then, as one stepping
lightly from ground tremulous to ground firm: “What
is the improper question that isn’t going to be improper?”</p>

<p>“It is about Jean, and if you don’t want to answer
it you can just make a face at me and tell me it is none
of my blessed business. Does Jean—do you think she
cares especially about—er—Philip?”</p>

<p>Again the dewy eyes were downcast. “Jeanie
doesn’t talk ve’y much about herself; I reckon—I mean,
I think you know that. Sometimes I surmise she cares
a heap about him, and sometimes I just don’t know.”
Then with a naïveté which stepped well back into
childhood: “I don’t think they’d be ve’y happy together;
do you?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know; maybe it’s just because Mr.
Philip is so sort of don’t-touch-me good; sort of Yankee-good,
ain’t—isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Since the Philip of the present moment was neither
“Yankee-good” nor any other kind, Bromley’s reply
to the innocent question was strictly aphoristic.</p>

<p>“When you grow up to be a woman, Mysie, you
will know that men are never any too good,” he returned
gravely; at which, declining a second cup of
coffee, he went away before he should be tempted to
say more.</p>

<p>Turning up at Madame Marchande’s at noon, he
found that Jean had been given a half-holiday, on
account of the slack midsummer season, and had gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
home. After he thought he had given her time enough
to eat her luncheon, he hired a horse and buggy for the
afternoon and drove over to the cottage in West
Denver.</p>

<p>“Get your things on and come along with me for
a ride,” he invited, when Jean came out to pet the
little white mare from the livery stable. “I want to
have a talk with you.”</p>

<p>“Is it about Philip?” she asked; and when he made
the sign of assent, she went in to get her coat and hat.</p>

<p>For the time it took the smart little mare to whisk
them across the bridge over the Platte, and up to the
farther heights on the north side overlooking the final
undulations of the great plain rolling up in swelling
land waves to break against Castle Rock and Table
Mountain, the driving of the spirited little horse gave
Bromley an excuse for postponing the thankless task
he had set himself. On the watershed height between
the Platte and Clear Creek, in sight of the great
house that “Brick” Pomeroy had built, or had begun
to build, in the flush times of the Clear Creek mining
boom, there was a tiny lake, tree-shadowed, and on its
shore he drove in among the cottonwoods and got out
and hitched the mare.</p>

<p>“I’ve been wanting to show you this glorious view,”
he said, as he helped his companion out of the high,
side-bar buggy. “Is there anything to match it in
Mississippi?”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “I think there is nothing like
it anywhere else in the wide world.”</p>

<p>Bromley took the lap-robe from the buggy and
spread it under one of the trees, and for a little time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
they sat quietly in the face of the magnificent sweep of
mountain grandeurs stretching from Long’s Peak on
the north around to the dim blue bulk of Pike’s on the
south. It was the young woman who broke the spell.
“You said you wanted to talk to me about Philip,”
she reminded him. “Did you find him?”</p>

<p>“No. He left Leadville about the same time that
I started from Denver. Our trains passed in the
night.”</p>

<p>“Then he is in Denver now?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Silence for a time, and then: “You needn’t be
afraid to tell me. I’m not a child.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll tell you what little there is to tell.
I got in late and found him in the rooms in the Alamo.
He was asleep in a chair when I went in, but he woke
up after a while and talked to me. Drew hadn’t exaggerated
any, whatsoever. Phil has hit the bottom,
good and hard.”</p>

<p>“He—he is drinking?”</p>

<p>“It is everything in the calendar, I guess—from
what he said.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you why?”</p>

<p>“No; he said that part of it was a shut door. But
he isn’t charging it up to the ‘why,’ whatever that may
be; he is calling it by its right name—his morbid self-righteousness
and weakness.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t weak,” she asserted quickly. “He may say
he is, but he isn’t.”</p>

<p>“I am merely telling you what he said. He was
bitter about it at first; called himself all sorts of hard
names—whited sepulchre and the like; but he softened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
down a bit before I left. What I am most afraid of
now is the reaction which is bound to come.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>Bromley stole a look aside to see how she was taking
it. Her gaze was fixed upon the distant mountain
skyline and there was nothing to indicate that she
was moved by any emotion deeper than a friendly concern
for the stumbler.</p>

<p>“We both know Philip pretty well,” he prefaced.
“When he quits coruscating—and I think he has
reached that point already—he will find himself in a
valley of humiliation too deep to climb out of; or he
will think it is. So he won’t try to climb; he will
merely try to expiate. And that pit is likely to be as
deep and as mucky as any other.”</p>

<p>“There was no mention made of his father?”</p>

<p>“No. But I am quite ready to accept your guess;
that Philip found his father somewhere—probably
that Monday night; and that he didn’t find what he
had hoped to find.”</p>

<p>“You mean he may have found that his father was
really a—a—that he <i>did</i> take the bank’s money?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it. From what Philip has told me I
have gathered that he was almost, or quite, alone in his
belief in his father’s innocence. If it has turned out
the other way, that would account for everything that
has happened. Phil would feel that he shared the
disgrace.”</p>

<p>Another little interval of silence, and at its end:
“What will you do, Harry?”</p>

<p>“I can’t do anything; he made that perfectly plain.
The most I could get out of him was a promise that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
he wouldn’t try to break with me. It is just as you
said Saturday at luncheon: he isn’t going to let anybody
help him.”</p>

<p>“No; I knew he wouldn’t. But you must try to
keep hold of him.”</p>

<p>“You may be sure I shall do that. You know how
much I owe to him—and to you.”</p>

<p>“You don’t owe me anything at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I do. Philip has told me, you know.”</p>

<p>“What did he tell you?”</p>

<p>“That you were the one who prompted him to take
me with him on the prospecting trip a year ago. I
was a down-and-out at that time; he knew it and you
knew it.”</p>

<p>She looked up with the light in the dark eyes that he
was never quite able to read or to fathom.</p>

<p>“We were both right: you have proved it. Philip
said to me once that whatever you had done, you had
kept your soul clean.”</p>

<p>“He did, eh? He said the same thing to me, no
longer ago than last night. That’s all either of you
know about it. A year ago I wasn’t worth the powder
it would have taken to blow me up, Jean; that is the
plain, unvarnished fact. I’m not right sure that I am
any better now; not in Philip’s definition of goodness.
Thanks to you and to him, I’ve got a pot of money;
and money brings responsibility; and responsibility
bespeaks some little effort at decent living. There you
have it in a nutshell.”</p>

<p>“I know,” she smiled; “I have heard you talk before.”
Then: “You spoke just now of Philip’s definition
of goodness. Don’t you think it is the right one?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>“Oh, yes; I suppose it is, when you come right down
to the foundation of things. The only danger is that
it may breed a prickly lot of spiritual pride. That was
the chief thing that was the matter with Phil—a pride
that made him not only hate the sin, but despise the
sinner. The pride is gone now, and in going it has
taken some of the righteous hardness along with it,
which, you might say, is all to the good. I don’t believe
he will ever set himself up in judgment again
upon the poor sinners—which is something gained, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but the price he is paying is terribly high.”</p>

<p>“Sure it is. Yet I’m not losing hope. There are
certain mazes in this thing we call life out of which
a man has to grope his own way, if he can. There is
good stuff in Phil—royally good stuff at bottom, as we
both know. If—in the reaction—he doesn’t do something
everlastingly to smash his whole future——”</p>

<p>She nodded slowly. “That is the greatest danger;
that he will cut himself off from every chance of getting
back. There are two Denvers over there,”—with a
glance backward at the city of the plain lying map-like
under the afternoon sun. “I think you know what I
mean.”</p>

<p>“I do. There are good doors that are slow to open
to the wayfarer, and a lot of bad ones that are always
open. At the present moment Philip is one of the
many drifters. But I am still betting on him.”</p>

<p>“If we only knew a little more about it,” she offered
musingly. “If we could find out where he went that
Monday evening after you left him——”</p>

<p>He took her up quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>“You’d like to have me try to run the thing down,
Jean?”</p>

<p>“I suppose we have no right to pry. And yet, if we
knew——”</p>

<p>“I understand. If we can place the father, we shall
at least know how bad things are, and if they are or are
not altogether past mending. I’ll do my best. Anything
else suggest itself?”</p>

<p>“You will not lose sight of Philip. He needs your
friendship now more than ever.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best there, too. But in his present frame
of mind it is going to be a man-sized job to brother
him, even a little. He thinks he has put himself beyond
the pale—says so in so many words. Another man
might say some such thing in a morning-after gust of
remorse; but he means it.”</p>

<p>“That is just it,” she said sorrowfully. “He is going
to punish himself a great deal more savagely than—than
he needs to. That is the part of his pride that
isn’t dead yet. Shall we go back now? If you don’t
mind, I—I think I’d like to go home.”</p>

<p>“Kittie will take you there as fast as we’ll let her,”
said Bromley cheerfully; and the little white mare confirmed
the promise at a pace that made her driver
wonder how she had ever come to be degraded to hack
service in a livery string. As he was cutting the buggy
at the cottage gate, Jean laid a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Please don’t say anything to Mummie or the girls,”
she begged.</p>

<p>“Not a word,” he agreed; and then: “You mustn’t
let it hit you too hard, Jeanie.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try not to. But you and Philip have been so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
good to us; and it seems such a pity!—so wretchedly
unnecessary.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t always given to us poor blind mortals to
distinguish between what is necessary and what isn’t,”
he countered comfortingly. And with this restating of
a truth which was hoary with age long before he was
born, he drove away, wiping his brow and muttering
under his breath. “Lord! I’m glad that much of it is
over, anyway. She never gave me a glimpse at that
stabbed little heart of hers, but I know how it hurt,
just the same.” Then, apostrophizing the offender:
“Phil, old boy, if you ever take a tumble to yourself
and realize what you’ve done, you’ll find you’ve got
something perilously resembling murder to answer
for ... you certainly will, for a fact!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bromley’s</span> efforts to trace Philip’s movements on
the Monday night of cataclysms were quite fruitless,
as they were likely to be, lacking help from the chapter
of accidents; and they so continued until a certain
morning when he went to the Union Depot to see the
Follansbees and Stephen Drew off for a trip to
Manitou. Walking back across the platforms after
the Rio Grande train had pulled out, he saw Jim Garth,
flannel-shirted, booted, and with a rifle under his arm
and a blanket roll over his shoulder, making for the
waiting South Park day train.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jim!” he called, turning to overtake the big
man. “What ho! Does this”—touching the blanket
roll—“mean that you’ve had enough of the bright
lights for a while?”</p>

<p>“You’re mighty whistlin’,” laughed the giant. “I
been a no-account bum on you two boys good-and-plenty
long enough, I reckon. I’m hittin’ for the big
hills and the tall timber where I can’t get a drink o’
red-eye, no matter how bad I’m a-hankerin’ for it—that’s
me.”</p>

<p>“But see here, old-timer; how about your grub-stake?”
queried Bromley, catching step and walking
with Garth to the waiting train. “You’re not going
to tell me that you saved enough for it out of the check
I slipped you a week ago?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>The big man grinned foolishly.</p>

<p>“You’re whistlin’ ag’in, Harry. That there fish-eyed
faro-dealer in Clem Bull’s place raked in the last dollar
o’ that hand-out afore I’d had time to say ‘Howdy’ to
it. I’d ’a’ gone hungry a heap o’ times since then if
it hadn’t been for Phil.”</p>

<p>“Phil?” said Bromley, recalling Philip’s stubborn
refusals to join in any of the check-slippings.</p>

<p>“Yep, you heard me,” Garth nodded, putting a foot
on the step of the car to be ready to swing up when the
starting signal should be given; “li’l’ old Phil. Yuh
recollect how he kind-a soured on me ’long to-wards
the last up at the ‘Jean,’ and after you and him come
here to Denver, he’d pass me in the street without ever
seein’ me—head up and eyes straight out in front,
like this”—illustrating in solemn burlesque. “But he’s
a whole lot different now; wouldn’t know him for the
same Phil a-tall.”</p>

<p>“How, different?”</p>

<p>Garth pushed his wide-brimmed hat back and
scratched his head with a reflective finger.</p>

<p>“Why, I dunno, eggzackly; more like folks, I reckon
you’d say. Met up with him yiste’day in Tom and
Jerry’s place, and he was leanin’ up ag’inst the bar,
a-pourin’ hisself a drink o’ red likker like a man.
Wouldn’t buy me a drink, though—no, sir-ree!—not on
your sweet life! What he done was to drag me off
into a corner and ask me if I didn’t want to go prospectin’;
allowed he’d stake me good if I’d premise not
to blow it; said he knowed if I’d promise, I’d stick.”</p>

<p>“Well?” queried Bromley.</p>

<p>“I shuck hands on it. He done it, and done it right.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
After we’d been to the bank, and down to Wolfe
Londoner’s place to git Wolfe to ship me a bunch o’
grub to Buena Vista, Phil, he kind-a hung on and
says, says he, ‘Damn it, Jim, I’m half a mind to go
along with you. When I git to thinkin’ about the
clean old hills....’ ‘Come on,’ says I, ‘and we’ll hunt
us up another li’l’ bonanza.’ But he says, ‘No, I ain’t
a coward, Jim; and that’s what I’d be if I took to the
hills now.’ What you reckon he meant by that?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Phil is the only one who knows the answer
to that question, Jim; and if he is, he won’t tell.”</p>

<p>“Speakin’ o’ Phil,” Garth went on, with a glance
over his shoulder to see if the train conductor was in
sight and ready to give the starting signal; “what-all
d’yuh reckon he’s got to do with that frozen-eyed faro-dealer
in Clem Bull’s?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; tell me,” said Bromley, suddenly
anxious to have the train starting further delayed.</p>

<p>“It was three-four weeks ago, one night after you’d
staked me,” Garth explained. “I’d gone into Bull’s
place, aimin’ to buck the tiger one more li’l’ whirl to
see if I couldn’t git some o’ my good money back ag’in,
and I happen’ to look over my shoulder and see Phil
a-follerin’ me. Reckoned he was aimin’ to knock me
down and drag me out for a cussed fool, so I dodged
him in the crowd and watched to see what he’d do.
He was lookin’ for me, all right; I could see that; but
when he come to the faro layout, he stopped dead,
like he’d been shot—jus’ stood there a-starin’ at that
dealer with his eyes a-buggin’ out.”</p>

<p>“And then?” Bromley prompted, hurriedly, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
the conductor was now coming down the platform,
clearance order in hand.</p>

<p>“Then he kind-a groped his way ’round the table and
touched old Fish-eye on the shoulder. Fish-eye, he
looks up and says somethin’, quiet-like, and then calls
in his mate to take the deal box, and goes off up-stairs
with Phil. That’s all I seen, but it got me guessin’.”</p>

<p>The train conductor had shouted his “All aboard!”
and the wheels were beginning to roll. Garth swung
up to the step, and there was time only for a hasty,
“So long! See you later!” and the big miner was gone.
Bromley walked up-town, soberly thoughtful; and that
evening, after dinner, drifted into the Bull “palace”
and slipped into the ring of onlookers at the faro game.
One appraisive look at the hard-faced man running
the cards from the dealer’s box was all that was needed,
and the play-boy saw to whom Philip owed his cool
gray eyes, thin-lipped mouth, and even the curious brow
cow-lick in his hair.</p>

<p>An hour later Bromley had sought and found a
redheaded young fellow whose job as a railroad passenger
agent brought him in contact with all sorts and
conditions of men—and women—in the strenuous
mother of mining-camps.</p>

<p>“You are a walking directory of this wild town,
Reddick,” the play-boy began, when he had trailed
the breezy young railroad man to his office in the Union
Depot. “Do you happen to know any of the regulars
in Clem Bull’s place?”</p>

<p>Reddick grinned. “All of ’em, I guess; it’s my business
to know people. Which one of Bull’s outfit are
you gunning for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“A sober, wooden-faced man, clean shaven, middle-aged,
with his hair turning gray, and with eyes as cold
as a fish’s. He is one of the faro dealers.”</p>

<p>“‘Deadwood’ Kent,” said Reddick, without a
moment’s hesitation. “Came from the Black Hills and
landed in Leadville with the first rush.”</p>

<p>“What sort?” Bromley queried.</p>

<p>“As tough as they make ’em. They say he had his
own private graveyard in the Hills, though that may be
just talk. But he did get his man in Leadville—which
may be the reason why he’s down here and not up
there. Better go loaded for bear if you’ve got a quarrel
with him.”</p>

<p>“Nothing like it; nothing but a bit of idle curiosity.
I thought he looked like a hard one, and I fancied
you’d know.”</p>

<p>“I do, and he is. New England born, I should say,
from his clipped way of talking. He is living with a
woman who is just about as tough as he is. I’ve seen
her working the boxes in the Corinthian.”</p>

<p>“Not married?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose not. People of his and her kind
don’t bother about the little moral formalities. Going
up-town? Wait a minute and I’ll walk with you. I’m
about through here.”</p>

<p>It was on the way up Seventeenth Street that Reddick
said: “Don’t see you and Phil Trask chasing
around together so much as you used to”—and stopped
short with that.</p>

<p>“No,” Bromley admitted. “I have the social bug,
more or less, and Phil hasn’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“Money doesn’t spoil some people,” remarked the
railroad man cryptically.</p>

<p>“But it does others? Chuck it out, Reddick. What
do you know about Phil?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I run across him here and there—in places
that I didn’t think he’d consent to be found dead in.
You see, I knew him when he was with the narrow-gauge
a year ago, before he went prospecting. In
those days all he needed to make him a saint was a
halo; but now he gambles a little, takes a drink when
he feels like it—does a lot of things you couldn’t have
hired him to do when he first came to Denver.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said the play-boy easily. “I take a drink
now and then, myself.”</p>

<p>“But I’ll bet a hen worth fifty dollars you don’t
take it solo, and in the places where I’ve seen Phil.
However, let’s forget it. It’s none of my business.”</p>

<p>At the corner of Curtis and Seventeenth, Bromley
bade his walking companion good-night and turned
westward. In the West Denver cottage he found
that Jean was the only one sitting up; she was trimming
a hat for herself.</p>

<p>“I was in hopes I’d find you still up,” said Bromley,
casting himself into the easiest chair the living-room
afforded; then, scanting all the preliminaries: “I have
found out what we wanted to know.”</p>

<p>It was not like her to demand details, and she did
not do so.</p>

<p>“Is it bad?” she asked, without looking up from her
work.</p>

<p>“Just about as bad as it can be. I got the clue from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
Jim Garth, and then went to see for myself. Afterward,
I talked with a man who knows.”</p>

<p>“It did happen that Monday night, then?”</p>

<p>“No doubt about it; though Garth couldn’t be sure
of the date.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Garth was there?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he saw Phil and his father when they met,
and saw them go off together. Things being as they
are, it isn’t much wonder that Phil went to pieces. A
whole worldful of misfortunes couldn’t have handed
out a blow that would more completely smash a man of
Phil’s make-up.”</p>

<p>“But Philip isn’t to blame for what his father has
done—or is!” she protested.</p>

<p>“It isn’t the blame Philip is taking; it’s the shame.”</p>

<p>“Does the man—Philip’s father—call himself by his
right name?”</p>

<p>Bromley’s smile was bleak. “No; he is known as
‘Deadwood’ Kent. It seems that he had decency
enough to take an <i>alias</i>—though it might have been
only for his own protection.”</p>

<p>“You think there is no doubt but that he took the
bank’s money?”</p>

<p>The bleak smile came again. “The man I’ve been
looking up this evening has done a good many worse
things than robbing a bank, if half of what people say
about him is true.”</p>

<p>“Poor Philip!” she sighed, and bent lower over her
sewing. Then: “He ought not to stay here in Denver,
Harry. Can’t you persuade him to go away?”</p>

<p>“Who? Philip, or the Kent person?”</p>

<p>“I meant Philip, of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“I doubt if he’ll budge. Yesterday he outfitted
Garth to go prospecting again, and said he had half a
mind to go along. But when Garth urged him, he
said no; that he’d be a coward if he took to the hills.”</p>

<p>She nodded. “I told you he would punish himself.
It is pitiful, isn’t it? Do you see much of him now?”</p>

<p>“Not as much as I should like to. He doesn’t dodge
me particularly, but he is keeping all sorts of hours, and
it is only a chance if I find him in his rooms when I
go up.”</p>

<p>“But when you do see him?” she prompted.</p>

<p>“He is a wonderfully changed man, Jean. You
wouldn’t know him at all for the old Philip. I don’t
know how to describe the change except to say that it
is somehow strangely softening—mollifying—if you
know what I mean. It is as if he’d been down into
the lower depths himself, and had learned to pity
rather than to condemn. His changed attitude toward
Jim Garth shows the line he is taking. He has never
had anything but harsh contempt for Garth and people
of his kind ... you know—people with appetites and
no self-control. But now he has done what I have
been trying all summer to do, and couldn’t: braced
Garth up and sent him into the mountains where he
will be out of the way of temptation.”</p>

<p>“I know,” came in low tones from the busy hat-trimmer.
“That is the real Philip. But it is terrible
that he had to suffer so before he could find himself.”</p>

<p>“He is still suffering; you can see that plainly
enough.”</p>

<p>“Is he—is he still drinking?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid he is; though perhaps not so much to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
excess; at least, I haven’t seen him the worse for liquor
since he came back from Leadville. As to that, this
wide-open town is partly to blame. It is no exaggeration
to say that half of the business of Denver is transacted
in the bar-rooms. I get it every day. The
minute I begin to talk business with a man, he will
say, ‘Well, let’s go and have a drink and talk it over.’
It is in the air.”</p>

<p>A pause for a few moments, and then Jean looked
up to say quietly: “Philip was here to-night.”</p>

<p>“What?—here in this house?”</p>

<p>“No; he just walked past—twice. I saw him
through the window.”</p>

<p>The play-boy got out of his chair and his voice shook
a little when he said:</p>

<p>“That is pathetic, Jean. It means that the sidewalk
in front of the house you live in is as near as he will
permit himself to approach the old relations. I’m going
to bed. For heaven’s sake, don’t sit up and work
yourself blind over that hat after you’ve already put
in a long day at the shop! Good-night.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was on the second evening after he had walked
up-town with Harry Bromley that Reddick, the railroad
passenger agent, squared himself at his desk in
the Union Depot office to scowl discontentedly at a
basket of freshly opened mail. Though the redheaded
young man boasted that he was case-hardened and had
no nerves, he had the quick sympathies of his temperament,
and he had lately figured in a business episode
the effect of which had been to leave him chafing and
ashamed and ready to quarrel with his job. While he
was absently fingering the letters in the “Unanswered”
basket, the door was opened and Philip drifted in.</p>

<p>“Loafing around down below, I saw your office
lighted and thought I’d climb up and smoke a pipe,”
was his greeting to Reddick. “If you are busy, go on
with your job and don’t mind me. I shan’t talk.”</p>

<p>The redheaded one tilted back in his pivot chair and
frowned.</p>

<p>“I can’t seem to get down to the job to-night, Phil.
I’ve just been a party to something that makes me sick
and disgusted with the railroad business and everything
connected with it in this blasted, rotten-egg town!”</p>

<p>“Turn it loose if you feel like it,” said the smoker.
“I’m a good listener.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t fit to talk about, but I’ll tell you and get it off
my chest. You may not know it, but women—of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
certain sort—are shipped into this over-manned town
like so much freight—prepaid freight, at that. The
landlady deposits the passage money with me, and has
me wire our agent in New York, or wherever it happens
to be, to deliver the ticket, check the woman’s trunk,
and send the check to me by mail. In that way the
woman lands in Denver in debt for her railroad fare,
and with her clothes in hock to secure the debt. You
can see how it works. It is slavery, pure and simple.
Once in the toils, the poor girl never has a chance to
get out, no matter how badly she may want to. She is
shipped from place to place, and always in debt; is kept
that way purposely.”</p>

<p>Philip swore softly. “You’re telling me that the
railroad companies accept that sort of blood money?”</p>

<p>Reddick shrugged.</p>

<p>“If you had worked in the traffic department instead
of the accounting, you’d know that the railroad, like
most corporations, doesn’t look for the finger-prints on
the money it takes in. My orders are to get business.
I got into this at first through playing square—through
the boss-women finding out that I didn’t graft on them
by overcharging—as nearly everybody else does; and
now the dirty business chases me—hunts me up.”</p>

<p>“You have had that kind of a job to-day?” Philip
asked.</p>

<p>“To-day it was a straight-out, bloody crime, Phil;
I’m confident of it. When I get to thinking about my
part in it, I want to go hang myself. Of course, this
traffic, most of it, is in women who know perfectly
well what they are doing; but now and then there are
exceptions—some careless or ignorant girl who is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
tolled along by rosy promises of an easy job in the
wild West. I had such a case as that this evening, and
it made me want to throw the whole cursed business of
railroading into the discard and go buy me a pick and
shovel.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have it,” said Philip shortly.</p>

<p>“The girl who came in this evening was ticketed
from Des Moines, but her folks—so she told me—live
on a farm somewhere north of the Iowa capital. I
had the check for her trunk, and I took her and her
baggage out to Madam Goguette’s, the place she was
booked for. Philip, as long as I live I shall never
forget the look in that girl’s eyes when she found out
what she was in for; the look and the way she burst
out crying and flung herself on the floor when she was
told that she couldn’t run away—that she’d have to stay
and work out her debt.”</p>

<p>“Pretty tough,” said the pipe smoker evenly. “But,
as you say, business is business.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say any such damned thing!” Reddick
broke out hotly. Then: “You’ve come to be a devilish
cold sort of fish since you struck it rich, Phil. A year
ago a story like this I’ve just told you would have made
you rush off and get a lawyer to swear out a writ of
<i>habeas corpus</i>, or something of that sort. But now
you merely say, ‘Pretty tough,’ and go on smoking
your rotten pipe!”</p>

<p>Philip smiled. “You get hot under the collar rather
easily, don’t you, Reddick? It is a good fault, and
sometimes I wish my own hair were a little nearer the
color of yours. I’ll quit you and let you get down to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
work. You won’t get anything done so long as you
have somebody around to beef at. Good-night.”</p>

<p>He was about to let himself out when Reddick halted
him.</p>

<p>“Hold up a minute, Phil. I’m no spoil-sport, or I
don’t mean to be, but while we’re talking about the
things that are and ought not to be, I want to make
a little roar for the underdog. You’ve been up here
evenings playing poker in the car-record office with
Middleton and some more of the clerks, off and on,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Now and again, yes. What about it?”</p>

<p>“Two things. While pretty nearly everything goes
in this wild and woolly neck of woods, it is still barely
possible that the Old Man might object to having the
car-record, or any other of his offices, turned into a
gambling shop. I have a horrible suspicion that he’ll
make it hot for somebody, when he finds out. That is
one thing, and the other is this: you oughtn’t to gamble
with those boys, Phil. They’re not in your class. You
carry too long a purse; you know you do. They have
nothing but their salaries.”</p>

<p>Philip’s smile was grim.</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask to be let in. I guess some of them
thought, because I happen to own a share in a gold mine,
I might be good picking. But you are right.
I shan’t rob them any more. Anything else on your
mind?”</p>

<p>“No. You are a pretty reasonable sort of devil, after
all, Phil. Are you going? Well, so long.”</p>

<p>Gaining the street level, the reasonable devil refilled
his pipe, lighted it, and set off briskly townward. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
square short of Larimer Street he turned to the left
past the house where he had once spent a drunkenly
unconscious night and went on to another of the same
character in the square beyond. The woman who admitted
him in answer to his double knock was of the
type of her class: large, shapeless, hard-eyed, painted
and garishly bejeweled. “Mother Goguette” was the
name she went by, but there was little that was motherly
about her.</p>

<p>Philip slipped out of his light overcoat and hung it
and his hat upon the hall rack as one who knew what
was expected of him.</p>

<p>“Reddick, the railroad man, tells me you took in a
new girl this evening,” he announced brusquely. “She
is the one I want to see.”</p>

<p>“And a lotta good it’ll do you!” was the snapped
out reply. “The little fool’s up in her room, cryin’ her
eyes out and tryin’ to make me believe she didn’t know
where she was comin’ to! She’s no fit comp’ny for a
gentleman like you. What she needs is somebody
that’ll knock a little sense into her.”</p>

<p>Philip felt in his pocket and put a gold coin into the
bejeweled hands.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a chance,” he said. “Which is her room?”</p>

<p>“First one to the right at the head o’ the stairs.
You’ll hear her snifflin’, most likely. Sure you wouldn’t
rather see one of the other girls?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure,” said Philip, and he ran up the carpeted
stair.</p>

<p>On the upper landing he had no difficulty in finding
the right door. It opened into a room lighted by a
single singing gas jet. Lying face downward on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
bed was a girl, “little” only by comparison with the
gross-bodied woman down-stairs who had used the
word. He had a glimpse of a swollen, tear-stained face,
the face of a frightened animal, lifted at the moment
of his entrance, only to be buried in the pillows again
when she saw him. He closed the door noiselessly and
drew up a chair.</p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid of me,” he began. “I
haven’t come here to make things worse for you. I’m
here to help you, if you want to be helped.”</p>

<p>The girl turned her face to the wall and sobbed
afresh.</p>

<p>“You’re lying to me—everybody’s lied to me. <i>She</i>
sent you up—I know she did!”</p>

<p>“No,” he denied gently; “I came because I knew you
were needing a friend—a real friend, I mean. Don’t
be afraid of me. Sit up here and tell me about it.”</p>

<p>She obeyed the quiet authority in his voice, sitting
dishevelled on the bed’s edge and wiping her swollen
eyes with a balled and tear-dampened handkerchief. It
was the commonplace story too often repeated, of a
country girl dissatisfied with the round of farm life;
of the lure of the city; and, finally, of the persuasion
of the tempter who had started her on the downward
road and finished by pretending to find her employment
in Denver.</p>

<p>Philip heard the story through to its pathetic end.
There was the stamp of truth on every part of the ill-worded
confession. It was plainly evident that the girl
was not yet old enough in guile to fabricate such a tale
on the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>“What may I call you?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>“Sadie Hansen’s my name.”</p>

<p>“All right, Sadie; let me ask you just one question:
would the old folks take you back if you should go
home now?”</p>

<p>“They—they’ve never quit writin’ me and beggin’
me to come. If they knew where I am now.... My
God—it would kill ’em!”</p>

<p>“Don’t cry any more; it’s all right. You are not
going to stay here.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve got to stay. That woman down-stairs says
she paid my fare out here, and she’ll make me stay till
I can pay her back!”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that. Have you unpacked your
trunk?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That’s good.” He rose and looked at his watch.
“Wash your face and comb your hair as quickly as
you can. Have you had any supper?”</p>

<p>“No; I couldn’t eat anything if I’d die for it.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that later. Straighten yourself up
and get ready to go. I’ll be back in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>She caught at him as he was turning away.</p>

<p>“Tell me what you’re goin’ to do to me! I’ll kill
myself if you——”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry; I’m going to send you home—back
to your people.”</p>

<p>Before he could stop her she had gone on her knees
to him in a frenzy of gratitude.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that!” he protested sharply, lifting her
to her feet. “There’s nothing to thank me for, and you
haven’t any time to lose. Get busy with the wash-basin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>In the lower hall he found the hard-faced woman
with the bejeweled ears, neck and hands. She was
evidently waiting to find out what would befall. Philip
was bluntly direct.</p>

<p>“That girl up there will never be any good to you,”
he asserted crisply. “If you will tell me how much
she owes you, I’ll pay her out and send her home.”</p>

<p>The woman saw her chance and grasped it avidly.</p>

<p>“Yes, you will!” she jeered. “I know your la-de-dah
kind. You want her for yourself. I’m short o’ girls,
and I ain’t goin’ to let her go!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I think you will,” he countered evenly.
“It is only a question of money, isn’t it? How much?”
and he drew out a handful of the gold coins.</p>

<p>The woman laughed, a hoarse chuckle with a choking
noise to punctuate it.</p>

<p>“Oh, well; if you’re so dead set on it, I’ll sell her
to you. How much will you give for her?”</p>

<p>Philip’s eyes burned and his reply was shot-like.</p>

<p>“I’ll pay the price of a human soul. It’s for you to
name it, if you haven’t forgotten that you have a soul
of your own.”</p>

<p>The woman shrank back as if he had struck her in
the face, and in a flash she became a snuffling suppliant.</p>

<p>“There, there, dearie—don’t you look at me that
way!” she whimpered. “Of course I ain’t sellin’ nobody’s
soul. You pay me what it cost to fetch her here
and take her along.” And she named the amount.</p>

<p>He counted the money out and gave it to her; after
which he stepped to the hall telephone and twisted the
crank until he got a connection with a near-by hack
stand. By the time he had brought the girl down, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
hack was at the curb. Sending the driver up for the
trunk, Philip led the girl to the door. As he did so,
the Goguette had recovered herself sufficiently to give
a parting flick of the whip.</p>

<p>“Good-by, girlie,” she said. “When he gets through
with you, you know where to come.”</p>

<p>“Don’t answer her,” said Philip in low tones; and
when the man came with the trunk he got a curt order:
“To the Union Depot, and be swift about it.”</p>

<p>At the station Philip again glanced at his watch.
There was still time enough, and he took the girl to
the depot restaurant, tipped a waiter for a rush order,
and told her she must eat. While she was at supper
he bought a ticket and a sleeping-car berth and checked
the shabby little trunk. Afterward, he went to sit with
her until she finished eating, telling her to take her
time; that he would see to it that she did not miss her
train. Now that she had bathed her face and eyes and
made herself presentable, he saw that she was, not
pretty, perhaps, but wholesomely comely; and though
she did not talk, the look in the big blue eyes that were
evidently an inheritance from her Swedish or Danish
ancestry was almost dog-like in its affection and
gratitude.</p>

<p>When he took her out to the waiting eastbound
train, the Denver &amp; Rio Grande express from Pueblo
and Colorado Springs had just pulled in, and if he
had looked aside he would have seen Bromley welcoming
a group of debarking travellers, with Stephen
Drew carrying a hand-bag for one of them—a very
beautiful and statuesque young woman with a peach-blow
complexion and hair like spun gold. Also, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
might have seen that, in the procession of the group
toward the station egress, Bromley lagged behind, with
an eye for himself and the girl standing at the steps
of the eastbound sleeper.</p>

<p>“You will find some money in this envelope with
the tickets,” he was saying to the girl, “and there is no
string tied to it. Just go back to your people and thank
God you’ve got the best part of your life before you
yet.”</p>

<p>It was then that Harry Bromley, glancing back over
his shoulder, saw a thing that he immediately wished he
had not seen. The girl had tucked the ticket envelope
into her bosom and put up her arms. “I wish you’d let
me kiss you, just once,” she said chokingly. “I never
knew there was ever such a man as you on top of God’s
green earth!”</p>

<p>“There isn’t—not the way you mean it,” Philip
denied quickly. “You mustn’t trust any of us—not
even me.” Then he took her round face between his
hands and kissed her and put her aboard her train; and
Bromley, having witnessed the parting, plodded on
after the Follansbee group, shaking his head and muttering
to himself. He had been hoping that Philip’s
plunge into the depths had stopped with the whiskey
bottle and the gaming tables, but here was proof positive
that it hadn’t. It was a man-killing world, this
world of the unfettered West, and the trail of the
serpent was over it all.</p>

<p>It was perhaps five minutes after the eastbound train
had clanked out over the station switches when Philip
lounged into Reddick’s office to lean upon the counter
rail and watch the passenger agent as he fingered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
keys of one of the lately introduced writing machines.
Reddick stopped his two-finger performance and looked
up to say, “Back again, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the lounger, “but not to stay; just to
ease your mind. The girl you were telling me about:
she is on her way back to her folks in Iowa, on the
train that has just pulled out. I don’t believe you will
have to check her trunk again.”</p>

<p>“You went up to the Goguette’s and got her out?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Reddick thrust a hand over the railing. “Shake!”
he said. “I wish there were more good devils like you
in this rotten world—good devils with money to burn.
I’d have done it myself, if I’d had the wherewithal.
But it was too near pay-day for me.”</p>

<p>“I know you would,” said Philip soberly; and as he
turned to go: “When you hear of any more jams like
that, just give me a tip, Reddick. As you say, I have
money to burn, and I haven’t much else. ’Night.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> seen the Follansbees and Stephen Drew off
for their hotel, Bromley lingered on the broad station-plaza
platform which served as a hack stand, knowing
that Philip must pass this way on his return up-town.
When Philip appeared at last, not through the station
archway, but at the foot of the stair leading down from
the offices on the second floor, the play-boy caught step
with him.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d show up if I waited long enough,”
he began. Then, taking a leaf out of Philip’s own
book of directness: “Who was the girl?”</p>

<p>Philip’s smile was soberly tolerant. “So you were
looking on, were you? What did you see?”</p>

<p>“I saw you kiss her and put her on the train.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“You mean it’s none of my business? I suppose it
isn’t. But I did hope you’d stop short of the women,
Phil.”</p>

<p>“Why should I?”</p>

<p>“For one reason, if for no other. You’ve been in
love with Jean; though you may think you are not,
you are still in love with her. How can you——”</p>

<p>Another man might have said the few words which
would have made all clear. But Philip Trask was of
those who rub salt into their own wounds and find a
certain gruesome satisfaction in the process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“You can’t think any worse of me than I think of
myself, Harry. As for Jean ... that is all over and
done with, as I told you in the beginning. The stars
are not more completely out of my reach, now.”</p>

<p>Bromley gave it up, and they walked on up-town in
silence until the Curtis Street corner was reached.</p>

<p>“Not going any farther my way?” Bromley inquired,
pausing before he turned westward.</p>

<p>The drifter’s laugh was brittle. “No. Your day is
ended, but mine is just fairly beginning. Good-night.”</p>

<p>It was on the day following this evening episode
that Bromley, dropping into Charpiot’s for luncheon,
found himself seated at a table for two with Reddick.
For a time the talk was of mines and mining, and the
opening of the new metal and coal fields in the Gunnison
country, toward which two railroads were hastily
extending their lines to accommodate the anticipated
rush to the new district.</p>

<p>“More flotsam and jetsam to be caught later in our
own little back-wash here in Denver,” was Reddick’s
cynical prophecy; “and more crooks and tinhorns and
highfliers to keep ’em company. I’m getting mighty
sick of all this high-keyed razzle-dazzle and excitement,
Harry. The pace is too swift for little Reddy. I don’t
suppose I had taken half a dozen drinks in my life
until after I came out here; and now I am getting to be
a walking whiskey-barrel.”</p>

<p>Bromley smiled. “Why don’t you cut it out?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Cut it out? I can’t—not in my business. I’ll give
you a sample. With the Tabor Opera House about to
open, theatrical companies are beginning to book the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
circuit—Denver, the Springs, Pueblo and Leadville—and,
of course, I try to get a share of the haul for my
railroad. This morning I went up to the Opera House
office to see one of the troupe managers, and the first
thing he did was to push the wall button for a round
of drinks. I’d had three or four already with other
pie-eyed patrons of the company, and when the bar-boy came,
I ordered a plain seltzer. ‘Whatzzat?’ shouts
the man from New York. ‘You’ll drink with me, or
you don’t carry us a mile over your damn’ railroad,
see?’ It made me so hot that I told him to go to hell,
and walked out—and I lose the business.”</p>

<p>“It is demoralizing, I grant you,” said Bromley.
“But Denver—all Colorado, for that matter—is merely
in the effervescent stage; it will settle down, after a
while.”</p>

<p>“Not until after it has beautifully spoiled a lot of us
fellows who would have been at least half-way decent,
normally. Just in my limited little circle I can point
you to dozens of young fellows who never had any leanings
toward the toboggan till they came West, but
they are on it now. I’m one of ’em, and your partner’s
another; only, as I told him last night, he can still be a
pretty good sort of devil when the fit strikes him.”</p>

<p>“Last night?” echoed the play-boy. “What, in
particular, happened last night?”</p>

<p>Briefly but succinctly Reddick told the story of the
assault upon the Goguette stronghold and its outcome.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Bromley at the finish; “I’m mighty glad
you told me that, Reddick. I saw him putting the girl
on the train and was by way of doing him a rank injustice.
Afterward, I offered him his chance to tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
me about it, but of course he wouldn’t take it; he isn’t
built that way.”</p>

<p>“You’ve hit the nail on the head, Harry. In some
ways, Phil is as queer as they make ’em. He has
developed into an all-night rounder, all right; don’t
make any mistake about that; but in spots he is as soft
nowadays as he used to be high-headed and flinty
when I first knew him a year ago. They tell me he
has his hand in his pocket for the down-and-out every
minute of the day. I’d like to know what hit him.
It must have been something pretty solid to give him
the jolt he’s had.”</p>

<p>“It was,” Bromley confirmed; but he added nothing
to the bare admission.</p>

<p>“Some girl go back on him?”</p>

<p>“No; for a man of his make-up it was something
even worse than that. I can’t tell you what it was,
because, thus far, it is his own secret—or he believes
it is.”</p>

<p>“I’ve quit,” said the passenger agent; and so the
subject died.</p>

<p>After this explanation of the girl-at-the-train incident,
Bromley breathed freer; and though he saw less
and less of Philip as time passed, he continued to hope
for the best, the hope founding itself upon nothing
better, however, than an illogical theory of reactions
good, bad and indifferent—swings of the pendulum, he
called them. When Philip should see the ghastly
emptiness of the life he was living—and he was too
intelligent not to see it, in time—he would pick himself
up out of the mire into which the blow to his pride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
had buffeted him and be the better and broader man
for the humbling experience.</p>

<p>Something of this confidence the play-boy tried to
pass on to Jean; and he could see that while she caught
at it eagerly there was always a shadow in the dark
eyes when Philip was mentioned. Bromley knew what
was behind the shadow: it was the fear that she had
once put into words—that the prisoner of reproach
would end by taking some step which could never be
retraced—that would put him once for all beyond the
hope of redemption and reinstatement. Wise in his
generation, the play-boy knew that there might be
such a step; knew, also, that a man of Philip’s temper
and resolution would be precisely the one to take it
if the expiatory urge should drive him far enough and
hard enough.</p>

<p>In these talks with Jean his heart went soft with
pity for her. It was plain enough now that she had
let herself go as far on the road to love for Philip as
Philip’s prideful self-repression had permitted her to
go; and at such times he would have given anything
he possessed to be able to comfort her. So far as he
might, with the Eugenia Follansbee entanglement still
tacitly binding him, he did what he could. On the
opening night at the new opera house, upon the building
and furnishing of which a princely fortune had
been lavished, he had all the Dabneys as his guests;
and thereafter, whenever he could persuade Jean to
go out, he took her and Mysie.</p>

<p>It was on one of these theater nights, when Mysie,
now in her final year in the University preparatory
school, and with lessons to prepare for the next day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
had failed him, that he discovered that his and Jean’s
seats were in the same row with those of Stephen
Drew, the judge and his wife and Eugenia. Since a
guilty conscience needs no accuser, he was not slow
to interpret Eugenia’s appraisive scrutiny of his companion
during the <i>entr’actes</i>; and when, in the dispersal
after the play, despite his best efforts to dodge the Follansbee
party in the outgoing crush, he found himself
and Jean jammed with Drew and Eugenia in the aisle,
he was not wholly unprepared for what followed.</p>

<p>“Introduce me,” was the whispered command from
the statuesque beauty upon Drew’s arm; and he obeyed,
with such formality as the informal conditions would
sanction. Then: “Harry has been neglecting us
shamefully of late, Miss Dabney. Can’t you persuade
him to be a little more neighborly with his old
friends?”</p>

<p>Bromley scarcely heard Jean’s murmured reply. He
made sure that the beauty’s conventional protest and
query were merely another command, and one which
he dare not ignore. Eugenia meant to have it out with
him. There was to be no more dallying and delaying.</p>

<p>With this discomforting thought in his mind the
short walk over to West Denver was begun in silence;
and it might have so continued and ended if Jean had
not opened the floodgates by asking a simple and most
natural question.</p>

<p>“Who is Miss Follansbee, Harry?”</p>

<p>It struck him as a piece of disloyalty of a sort that
he had never mentioned the Follansbees by name to
her, though he had often spoken of his friends from
Philadelphia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“What did you think of her?” he evaded.</p>

<p>“I think she is the most beautiful woman I have ever
seen.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you think there was something lacking in
a man who couldn’t fall in love with her at sight?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that doesn’t necessarily follow,” was the cool-voiced
rejoinder. “Love won’t always go where it is
sent—or come when it is called.”</p>

<p>It all came out then; the story of the family alliance
and agreement, planned while he and Eugenia were
mere babes in arms; its tacit acceptance by both as
they grew up; his own abnormal and inexcusable distaste
for it and rebellion against it—an attitude which,
he had every reason to believe, was not shared by
Eugenia.</p>

<p>“You know something about my ratty life in the
past, Jean,” he went on. “While I was doing my best
to break all of the Ten Commandments, the thing fell
down of its own weight, naturally. I wasn’t an
‘eligible,’ even in society’s rather loose interpretation
of the word. But now——”</p>

<p>“But now you are no longer living that kind of a
life, and you are a rich man,” she finished for him.
“You are going to marry her?”</p>

<p>“It is up to me, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No. I should say a thousand times, no.”</p>

<p>“Why isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Because you couldn’t do her a greater wrong than
by marrying her when you don’t love her.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think I could make her happy?”</p>

<p>“I think you could make any woman happy, in a
way, if you tried. But that isn’t the question. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
doubt there are many marriages made without love,
of the kind we are talking about, on either side; and
they are happy, after a fashion. But where there is
love on one side and only consent on the other ... I
can’t conceive of anything more dreadful for the loving
one.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right. Just the same, I don’t see
where you get all this wisdom of the ages, Jean. I’ve
often wondered if there were ever a wall of sophistry
built so thick that you couldn’t see through it at a
glance.”</p>

<p>“I have lived a long time in the past year, Harry;
you know that,” she answered, with a little catch in
her voice; and then she began to talk about the play
they had just sat through, and there were no more
confidences.</p>

<p>Dutifully obeying the command concealed under the
conventional protest and query, Bromley made a telephone
appointment with Eugenia, and at the proper
calling hour the following afternoon presented himself
at the furnished house in Champa Street taken
for the season by the Follansbees. It was the statuesque
beauty herself who admitted him and led the
way to the darkened drawing-room, and her first question,
when they were alone together, was disconcertingly
direct.</p>

<p>“This Miss Dabney I met last night, Harry: is she
the daughter of the widow you are boarding with in
West Denver?”</p>

<p>“One of three daughters; the others are schoolgirls.
Jean is the man of the family; she is a hat-trimmer in
Madame Marchande’s.” It took a good deal to shake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
the play-boy’s easy confidence in himself, but he had
a feeling that if he gave the grim demon of consternation
the merest shadow of an opening, he would be
lost.</p>

<p>“She is a very pretty girl; much too pretty to be
wearing out her life in a millinery shop, don’t you
think?”</p>

<p>“I do,” he asserted frankly. “But there seems to be
no present help for it.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there? When I saw her with you last night,
I was—I was——”</p>

<p>Coming in out of the bright sunlight, Bromley had
been half blind in the cool, darkened room. But now
that his eyes were becoming accustomed to the gloom
he saw that his lovely questioner had stopped in curious
embarrassment. Her eyes were downcast and she
was folding and refolding the filmy handkerchief in
her lap. Suddenly she left her chair and came to sit
beside him on the old-fashioned, rep-covered sofa.</p>

<p>“Harry, dear,” she began, “I have something terrible
to confess; but first let me ask you.... Last
night, you know, when I saw you with Miss Dabney,
and saw how pretty and sweet she is ... Harry,
aren’t you the least bit in love with her?”</p>

<p>He tried to turn the question aside with a laugh.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t ask that if you could see her sister
next younger. Mysie is the raving beauty of the
family.”</p>

<p>“No, but, really, Harry; I’m dreadfully in earnest.
Wouldn’t you marry Jean Dabney if you were—if
you were free?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>Again he evaded, rather clumsily—for him—this
time.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t rest with me, Eugie. Jean hasn’t the
remotest idea of marrying anybody.”</p>

<p>The beauty beside him, statuesque no longer, but
almost girlish in her confusion, sighed deeply.</p>

<p>“You are making it terribly hard for me, Harry,
but I suppose I deserve every bit of it. I—I’ve been
untrue to you and to our—to our engagement.”</p>

<p>It took every atom of his self-control to keep him
from bounding to his feet. “Wha—what’s that?” he
gasped.</p>

<p>“It’s your fault, in a way,” she pleaded defensively.
“We might never have known anything about Mr.
Drew if you hadn’t told him we were here in Denver.”</p>

<p>“Stephen Drew!” He almost shouted the name.</p>

<p>“Yes. He asked me last night, you know—after we
came home from the theater. I tried to stop him; I
knew I ought to; but—but he wouldn’t stop.”</p>

<p>He turned and put his hands on her shoulders.
“Tell me just one thing, Eugie: do you love Steve
Drew? Is that it?”</p>

<p>She lifted swimming eyes to his for a flitting instant
and then dropped them quickly.</p>

<p>“You can say anything you please to me, Harry,
dear; I know I deserve it: but—but I love him so hard
that it hurts—actually <i>hurts</i>!”</p>

<p>“God bless you, Eugie, dear,” he broke out, taking
her in his arms and kissing the tears away. “Don’t you
cry for a single minute. Your happiness is all I care
for—all I’ve ever cared for. And you have picked
a man in all his inches. Don’t you fret the least little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
bit about a thing that was handed out to us, wrapped
up in the original package years and years ago, by
the old folks!”</p>

<p>“You—you’re not sorry—not even a little?” she
faltered.</p>

<p>“How could I be sorry when you have found your
true happiness, my dear? That is the biggest thing in
the world. And Steve will make you happy. He is
one of the finest!—head and shoulders above any other
man I’ve met in Colorado. I wouldn’t give you up to
a rotter: but to Stephen Drew.... But see here, I’ve
got an appointment at the bank, and it’s nearly closing
time, right now. Will you forgive me if I run?”</p>

<p>She got up and went with him to the door. At the
moment of leave-taking she said shyly: “You’ll marry
Miss Dabney some day, won’t you, Harry? I want
you to be happy, too.”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to marry anybody to be happy; I’m
perfectly happy this minute, because you are. As for
Jean ... as I’ve said, I’m sure she isn’t thinking
about marrying. There was—er—another man, you
know, and he has put himself out of the running. That
is why I’ve been taking her out a bit and trying to make
it easier for her. She is a dear girl, and I wish you
knew her better. They are good people—good old
Southern stock left poor by the war. Isn’t that your
telephone ringing? I’ll bet that is Drew, wanting
to tell you he is coming out. I’m escaping just in
time. Good-by, you happy girl!” And, kissing her
again, and even more exuberantly than before, he fled
to keep the mythical appointment.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was on one of these matchless September nights,
when the stars were blazing in the black bowl of the
heavens with a lustrous brilliancy that shamed the flaring
gas street-lamps of the city of the plain, that the
younger son of an English lord, who was supposed
to be learning cattle ranching at first-hand on a range
in Middle Park, wound up a day of gaudy dissipation
in Denver by galloping his bronco down Holladay
Street, yelling like a madman and firing his pistols
right and left in true Wild West fashion.</p>

<p>To escape the flying bullets, the few late-hour
pedestrians dodged for shelter as best they might, darting
into alleyways or disappearing through doors that
were always open after candle-lighting. As on a certain
other epoch-marking night, Philip found his door
of refuge opening for him apparently of its own
accord, and when it was quickly closed behind him a
pair of silken-soft arms went about his neck, and a
voice that he had recalled many times in the past few
weeks said, “Gee, Mr. Prince-man! It took you a fine
long time to remember where I lived, didn’t it? But
I knew you’d come, some time. That shooting fool
didn’t hit you, did he?”</p>

<p>Philip unwound the clinging arms from his neck,
but he did it gently.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not hurt,” he answered. “I was on my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
way here, and all he did was to hurry me a little.
Were you expecting anybody else?”</p>

<p>“Not me. I’d just come down when I heard the
racket in the street and was opening the door to see
what had broke loose. Want to go in the parlor with
the bunch for a while?”</p>

<p>“No; we’ll go up to your room. I want to talk
to you.”</p>

<p>She slipped an arm around him as they went up the
stairs together, saying: “This is like old times, only the
other time you was too parboiled to know where you
was going. You ain’t been drinking to-night, have
you?”</p>

<p>“Not enough to amount to anything. I am as nearly
sober as I ever get to be, nowadays.”</p>

<p>In the room above a gas jet was burning low, and
the girl turned it on full. Philip took off his hat and
coat and threw them on the bed.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to drink any more to-night, and I
don’t want you to drink,” he said. “But I’ll pay my
way, just the same.” He handed her a twenty-dollar
gold piece: “Take this down to Madam Blanche and
tell her your friend is buying her best for the house,
and that it is the price he is paying to be let alone.”</p>

<p>While she was gone, he made a slow circuit of the
room, alert to all the small details of his surroundings.
By this time he knew the household routine of such
places—that each woman took care of her own room.
There were little hints of personality that were not
lost upon him: a single late-blooming rose in a tiny
vase on the dresser, placed exactly in the middle of
the freshly laundered linen cover; the girl’s comb and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
brush and toilet appliances as clean and shining as if
they had just come from the shop; spotless cleanliness
everywhere. He pulled the dresser drawers open, one
by one; here, too, there were decent orderliness and the
smell of fresh laundering.</p>

<p>She came in just as he was closing the drawers and
laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Didn’t find anything to bite you, did you?” she
asked. Then: “Blanche says the house is yours.
She’ll turn everybody else out in the street, if you
say so.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any part of the house but this,” he
returned. Then he reminded her of an omission:
“When I was here before, you didn’t tell me your
name.”</p>

<p>“A name’s nothing. They call me ‘Little Irish’ here,
and I’ve never told ’em the name my mother gave me.”</p>

<p>“But you will tell me, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“If you care enough for me to want to know. It’s
Mona—Mona Connaghey is the whole of it.”</p>

<p>Philip sat down, and immediately she came and
perched on his knee. Almost roughly he caught her
up and planted her in a chair.</p>

<p>“I want to talk sense to you, Mona, and I can’t do
it if you stir up the devil in me,” he told her soberly.</p>

<p>“Is it the devil you’re calling it?” she laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes; and you know well enough that is the right
name for it. But never mind; let me ask you this:
I know it is a part of your business to tell lies and
nothing but lies to any man who comes here. Can
you tell the truth for once in a way, if you try?”</p>

<p>“I guess so, maybe—to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>He fixed her with a half-absent gaze. “How old
are you, Mona?”</p>

<p>“If I live till Christmas, I’ll be twenty.”</p>

<p>“Twenty years old and well on the road to hell,”
he said musingly; adding: “Or perhaps you are not
calling it hell?”</p>

<p>“Am I not?” she flashed back. “But what’s the
use? You didn’t come here to put the whip to me, did
you? God knows, I can do that well enough for
myself!”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, “I came to ask you a few questions.
What is there for a woman in your condition
to look forward to?—or is there anything?”</p>

<p>Her lips twisted in a wry smile.</p>

<p>“A few years of this, maybe, and then a little bigger
dose of the chloral than it takes to put you to sleep.
That is, for them that have got the nerve.”</p>

<p>“Nothing else?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; in a way of speaking. Once in a while a
bit of heaven comes now and then to one or another of
us—when some man lets a girl go and live with him till
he gets tired of her.”</p>

<p>“And you call that heaven?”</p>

<p>“Some does: for me, I’d say it depends on who the
man is.”</p>

<p>He lighted a cigar and puffed at it in silence. And
when he spoke again: “Do you care to tell me what
brought you to this, Mona?”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t want to know.” Then, in lower
tones and with her face averted: “I ain’t got no hard-luck
story to tell. I just went bad because I was ...
but what’s the use of trying to make you see? It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
just in the blood, or it ain’t; and I’m thinking it ain’t
in your blood at all.”</p>

<p>He smiled soberly.</p>

<p>“Maybe there are worse things in my blood than
anything you will ever have to plead guilty to. But
that is neither here nor there. Tell me this, Mona:
if you could have one wish, and could be sure it would
be granted, what would it be?”</p>

<p>“My God! Can you ask me that?—after what I’ve
been telling you?”</p>

<p>“I can and I do. I have been thinking a good deal
about you since—since that morning when you sat here
on the bed and told me how I came to be here in this
room. You were honest with me then. I’ve been
wondering if you could go on being honest with me.”</p>

<p>“You mean that you’d take me out of this—for a
little while—and let me—let me——”</p>

<p>“No,” he denied gravely; “I didn’t mean that. But
if I should do that—what then?”</p>

<p>A soft light leaped into the blue Irish eyes and for
a moment the reckless look vanished and the girl’s face
became almost beautiful.</p>

<p>“I’d—I’d work my fingers to the bone to make it
last as long as I could—with you!”</p>

<p>“Why with me, rather than with another man?”</p>

<p>“I can tell,” she said. “You’re not like other men.
Even when you’re drunk, you don’t forget. I know!”</p>

<p>Another little silence, and at the end of it: “You
must know the truth about me, Mona. I have been
to the bottom—I’m on the bottom, now; just as much
out of the decent running as you are. And I have
fallen so hard that it makes me feel for other people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
who are caught and can’t get loose. Can you understand
that?”</p>

<p>“It’s terribly dumb I’d be if I couldn’t—the way
I’m living.”</p>

<p>“All right; then we’ll go on. When I was here
before it seemed to me that you hadn’t gone quite
stony hard—as some of them do; that if you had a
chance, you might climb back. Would you?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“There’s no chance for the woman; you’d know that
very well.”</p>

<p>“There is one chance; just one, I suppose. Do you
want to get out of this badly enough to marry me,
Mona?”</p>

<p>“<i>Marry you?</i> My God, man, what are you talking
about! Do you think I’d——”</p>

<p>“Wait,” he commanded; “let me finish. We won’t
say anything about love; we’ll leave that out of it.
I have money, and I can take you away from Denver,
where you are known, and give you your chance to
straighten up. No, I am neither drunk nor crazy, and
this is no sudden thing with me. I know what I am
proposing, and I want to do it. I have talked with a
man who knows you, and he tells me you have no home
to go to; no people of your own who would take you in.
That is why I am offering you a chance with me.”</p>

<p>To his astonishment the girl sprang up and flung herself
upon the bed, burying her face in his overcoat and
sobbing as if her heart would break. He let her alone;
let the fit of weeping exhaust itself. It was a good sign,
he decided; it showed that there were still depths that
could be touched—deeply touched. But he was wholly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
unprepared for what followed when she sat up, wiping
her eyes and smiling at him through her tears. For
this is what she said:</p>

<p>“You dear, dear man! Do you know, I’d rather die,
right here in this room to-night, than marry you?”</p>

<p>“But why?” he demanded. “Don’t you want to get
out of this life?”</p>

<p>“Not at the price—the price you’d have to pay. Oh,
don’t I know? There’s not a corner on God’s green
earth you could take me to where there wouldn’t be
some man to turn up and say, ‘Hell’s chickens! there’s
“Little Irish”—the girl that used to be in Madam
Blanche’s in Denver!’ And that isn’t all, either, nor
the worst of it. Some day you’ll brace up and go back
to the other world—the one you come from. A man
can do that whenever he likes, and you’ll do it. And
then you’d be tied to a——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say it,” he interrupted quickly. “What you
are saying only makes me more determined. I shall
get a license in the morning, and to-morrow afternoon
I shall expect you to be ready to go with me.” He
threw a handful of gold coins on the bed. “There is
money to square you with Madam Blanche, and to pay
for whatever you want to buy. Let me have my
coat.”</p>

<p>For a moment, while he was struggling into his coat,
he thought she had acquiesced. She sat on the bed
with her hands tightly clasped and would not look up
at him. Dimly he sensed that there was a struggle of
some sort making the tapering shapely fingers grip until
they were bloodless. Then....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>When he won out to the open air of the street his
brow was wet and his hands were trembling. There
had been a fierce battle in the upper room, and he had
come out of it a victor, though only in the strength of
a glimpse into the heart of a woman—a glimpse vouchsafed
to him in the thick of the struggle. With every
wile and weapon she possessed she had fought to make
him stay; and but for the saving glimpse which had
shown him what her real object was, he might have
yielded.</p>

<p>“Poor little lost soul!” he muttered, as he turned
his steps toward the better-lighted cross street. “Reddick
didn’t strain the truth when he said she had
heroine stuff in her. She knew if she could make me
stay, there would be no more talk of marriage; and it
was for me that she wanted to kill that chance—not for
herself. What a hell of a world this is, anyway!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the forenoon following the Englishman’s
staging of an imitative attempt to “shoot up the town”
that Reddick spent an earnest hour trying to find
Bromley, and finally ran across him as he was coming
out of the Colorado National Bank.</p>

<p>“Been hunting high and low for you,” said the redheaded
one. “There is the devil to pay and no pitch
hot. Have you seen Phil this morning?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the play-boy.</p>

<p>“Well, I have. One of our county officials is sending
his family east, and I went up to the court house
this morning to take him the tickets. While I was there,
Phil came in and went through some sort of business
at the counter. He didn’t see me; and after he was
gone, I was curious enough to go and pry. He is
taking the big jump, Harry—the one that will smother
him for life! His business at the court house was to
take out a marriage license for himself and ‘Little
Irish’ Connaghey!”</p>

<p>“And who is the Connaghey?”</p>

<p>“She is a girl in Madam Blanche’s. Phil was asking
me about her the other day. I told him the truth; that
she was one of the straightest of the lot—for whatever
that was worth. I thought he might be wanting to help
her in some way, but I hadn’t the remotest idea he was
thinking of making a complete fool of himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>“Where did Phil go after he left the court house?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I haven’t seen him since. It’s up to
you to hustle, Harry. If this thing goes through, it
is the end of Phil Trask. You know that as well as
I do.”</p>

<p>“I do, indeed. Thank you for putting me on. I’ll
find Phil, if I have to take out a search warrant for
him.”</p>

<p>Losing no time, Bromley went first to the Alamo
Building, and in the upper corridor he met a Jew
second-hand furniture dealer coming out of Philip’s
rooms and his heart sank. This meant that Philip was
already disposing of his effects and preparing for flight.
In the sitting-room he found Philip packing a trunk.</p>

<p>“Quit that, Phil, for a minute or so and talk to me,”
he began abruptly. Then: “We’ll skip the preliminaries;
I know all about it—what you’ve done, and
what you are intending to do. Don’t you know that it
is preposterously impossible?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” was the firm denial. “It isn’t impossible.
Jim Garth did it, and nothing but good came
of it. He would be a different man to-day if the
woman he rescued and married hadn’t died. But that
is beside the mark, Harry. You know what I have
done: I have spoiled my life, and I am no better than
the woman I am going to marry; not half as good in
some respects.”</p>

<p>“She isn’t too good to let you ruin yourself, world
without end, by marrying her!” retorted the play-boy.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken again,” was the mild dissent.
“She proved to me, no longer ago than last night, that
she was capable of sacrificing herself utterly to break<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
my determination. I have come around to your point
of view, Harry. There is no poor wretch on earth too
low down to answer the appeal if one only knows how
to make it. It has cost me pretty much everything I
value, or used to value, to learn this, but I have learned
it, at last.”</p>

<p>“But, good heavens—you can’t love this woman!”</p>

<p>“Who said anything about love? Don’t make another
mistake, Harry; it isn’t an infatuation. I am
merely giving this girl a chance to become what God
intended her to be—a one-man woman; and the obligation
this will impose will keep me from sinking any
deeper in the mud—or I hope it may.”</p>

<p>For a fervid half-hour the play-boy argued and
pleaded, all to no purpose. It was quite in vain that,
argument and persuasion failing, he plied the whip,
refusing to credit the altruistic motive, and accusing
Philip of making the final and fatal sacrifice to his own
swollen ego; not, indeed, that he believed this to be
wholly true, but only that he hoped there might be
enough of the steel of truth in it to strike fire upon the
hard flint of Philip’s desperate resolution.</p>

<p>“If that is your motive—a monkish idea that by
punishing yourself you can wipe the slate of whatever
things you’ve been writing on it since you let yourself
go—it’s a gross fallacy, Phil, and you know it. You
may fool yourself, but you can’t fool the God you still
believe in.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got me all wrong, Harry,” was the placatory
answer to this. “I am still enough of a Christian to
believe that there is only one sacrifice for sin. That
isn’t it at all. I’m not trying to atone; I am merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
trying to give another human being, to whose plane I
have sunk myself, a chance for the only redemption
that can ever come to her—in this life. I wish I could
make you understand that I am not playing to my own
gallery—not consciously, at least. The ego you speak
of is very dead, these days. God knows, it needed to
die. It wasn’t fit to live.”</p>

<p>It was in sheer desperation that Bromley fired his
final shot.</p>

<p>“You told me once, Phil, that you had never said or
done anything to let Jean know that you were in love
with her, or to win her love. That was not true.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean.”</p>

<p>“I mean just this: that you did win her love, whether
you meant to or not.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it, Harry; but if it were true, it
applied only to the Philip Trask she knew—or thought
she knew—and not at all to the man who is going to
marry Mona Connaghey. Surely you can see that?”</p>

<p>“I can see that you don’t yet know any more about
women than a new-born baby!” was the fierce retort.
“I have been living in the same house with Jean Dabney
all summer, and——”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” Philip interposed; “let’s get this thing
straight, while we are about it. I love Jean Dabney;
I never knew how much I loved her until after I had
made it a shame to think of her in the same breath
with myself. But I have done just that, Harry.
Whatever else I have gained or lost in the past few
months, I haven’t lost the sense of the fitness of
things. If Jean knew ... but probably she does
know ... that is the bitterest drop in the cup for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
me ... to know that she’d feel she’d be obliged to
cross the street to avoid meeting me. But what is done
is done, and can’t be undone.”</p>

<p>“Then there is nothing I can say or do that will keep
you from taking this last long jump into the depths?”
said the play-boy, disheartened at last.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all. It is no sudden impulse. I have
considered it well in all its bearings. We shall go away
from Denver, of course; the farther the better. If I
don’t see you again——”</p>

<p>A lump came into Bromley’s throat as he grasped the
hand of leave-taking, and the fierceness of what he said
was only a mask for the emotion that was shaking
him.</p>

<p>“You are a hideous fool, Phil, and if I did what I
ought to, I’d break a chair over your head to bring
you to your senses. Since I can’t do that—well, I
hope the time may never come when you’d sell your
soul to undo what you are planning to do to-day.
Good-by.”</p>

<p>In the street the play-boy hesitated, but only for a
moment. He knew, none better, what a blow this last
irrevocable plunge of Philip’s would be to the woman
who had loved him—who still loved him—and his one
thought, born of manly pity and sympathy, was to
soften the blow for her, if that could be done.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he was leaning upon the counter
in Madame Marchande’s millinery shop and making his
plea to the ample-bodied Frenchwoman into whose
good graces he had long since won his way.</p>

<p>“Ah, Monsieur; I think you will make marry with
this preetty Mees Jean wan day, is it not? Then I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
lose my bes’ hat-trimmer. How you goin’ pay me for
dat, eh? You say you’ll wan’ take her for buggy ride?
<i>Eh bien</i>; she can go w’en you come for her.”</p>

<p>Bromley ate his luncheon alone. What he had to say
to Jean could not be said across a restaurant table.
Moreover, he knew she had carried her luncheon to
the shop, as usual. As soon as he thought he had
given her time to eat it, he called for her, with the
little white mare of the livery string between the shafts
of the light side-bar buggy.</p>

<p>“How did you know that I was tired enough to fairly
long for a half-holiday?” she asked, as the little mare
whisked them over the long Platte River bridge in a
direction they had once before driven, toward the
Highlands.</p>

<p>“How does anybody know anything?” he returned,
smiling and adding: “I flatter myself that there is not
much about you that I don’t know, Jeanie, dear.”</p>

<p>“I wonder?” she said soberly; then: “You have been
a good brother to me this summer, Harry.”</p>

<p>“I hope I have been something more than a brother.
Brothers are not exactly my idea of a hilariously good
time. Shall we drive on up to our little lake?”</p>

<p>“Anywhere you please. It is such a joy to be out
of the shop and outdoors on a day like this that places
don’t matter in the least.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, he repeated the programme of the
former excursion, hitching the mare among the cottonwoods
on the shore of the tiny highland lake, and
spreading the lap-robe on the hillside where they had sat
once before to revel in the glorious view of sky-pitched
mountains and swelling plain. For a time they spoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
of nothing but the view; but that was only because
Bromley was waiting for his opening. It came when
Jean said:</p>

<p>“The other time we sat here it was to talk about
Philip. Do you see much of him now?”</p>

<p>“Not very much.” Then he took his courage firmly
in hand: “I am afraid we shall have to forget Philip,
in a way, Jean. Do you think you can do that?”</p>

<p>“Why should we forget him?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t answered my question.”</p>

<p>“You can’t always forget people just because you
might want—because it might be best to forget them.”</p>

<p>“But—what if they deliberately walk out of the
picture?”</p>

<p>She looked up quickly, and in the pools of the dark
eyes there was the shock of a fear realized.</p>

<p>“Philip has done that?” she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“That is what it amounts to. You remember what
you once said: that he might do the irrevocable thing
that would cut him off from us for good and all?”</p>

<p>“I remember.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is done; or the same as done.”</p>

<p>She drew a quick breath. “Tell me, Harry.”</p>

<p>“I will, but only because you’d have to know it anyhow,
a little later. This morning he took out a marriage
license for himself and a—a—I can’t name the
woman for you, Jean. I suppose they are married by
this time. Will you believe me when I say that I did
everything I could think of to prevent it?”</p>

<p>There was no answer to this, and when he looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
aside at her again he saw that she was crying quietly,
and his heart grew hot.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry,” he broke out almost roughly. “He isn’t
worth it, Jean.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is,” she faltered. “You don’t know him as
I do, Harry; though you have been more to him and
closer to him than I ever could be. <i>I</i> know why he
has done this.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I do, too,” he admitted grudgingly.
“I must talk plainly to you this once, Jean, if I never
do again. The woman is—oh, well, we’ll say she is
pretty nearly everything she ought not to be; and Philip
thinks and says that he can go no lower than he has
already gone. What he said to me when I wrestled
with him was this: ‘I’m merely trying to give another
human being, to whose plane I have sunk myself, a
chance for the only redemption that can ever come to
her—in this life.’ And I’ll do him this much justice:
he didn’t know—because I couldn’t tell him—how
much it was going to hurt you.”</p>

<p>A cool breeze swept across the plain from the mountain
rampart in the west, and the yellow leaves of the
cottonwoods sifted down upon them in a golden
shower. Over in the Clear Creek valley a freight train
inched its way along toward Denver like a monstrous
caterpillar. In the transparent atmosphere of the perfect
autumn day Long’s Peak stood out as clearly as
if its vast bulk rose from just behind the nearest
swelling of the foot-hills. When the silence grew over-long,
the play-boy spoke again.</p>

<p>“Philip didn’t know—doesn’t know; but I have
known all along. You love him, Jean. It is nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
to be ashamed of,” he hastened to add. “It is just
something to be sorry for, now. I know well enough
you can never give another man what you have given
him ... but I want the right to stand by you—to
comfort you. I’m asking you to marry me, Jean,
dear.”</p>

<p>The shock of a fear realized had gone out of her
eyes when she turned to him, and in its place there
was something almost like adoration.</p>

<p>“You’d make sacrifices, too, wouldn’t you?” she said,
very gently. Then: “Are you forgetting Miss
Follansbee?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; Eugie is going to marry Stephen Drew. I
meant to have told you. It is to be next month, I
believe.”</p>

<p>Another speechless moment while a second shower
of the yellow leaves came circling down. Then she
spoke again, still more gently.</p>

<p>“I think you are one of God’s gentlemen, Harry; I
shall always think so. But there are two good reasons
why we can’t marry. One is——”</p>

<p>“I know what you are going to say,” he interrupted:
“that I don’t love you at all—in a marrying way; that
I am only sorry for you. But let that go. Suppose
there isn’t any marrying love on either side. You remember
what you said the evening when I told you
about Eugie; that people might marry and be a comfort
to each other without that kind of love. Besides, when
you come right down to it, what is marrying love,
anyway?”</p>

<p>She got up and shook the fallen leaves from her lap.</p>

<p>“You have given one of the reasons, Harry; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
some day, when you are not expecting it, I may hold
a looking-glass before you and show you the other.
You ask me what marrying love is: it is what I have
seen, more than once, in your eyes ... and you were
not looking at me. Let us get in and drive somewhere
else. I don’t believe I shall ever want to come back to
this place again.”</p>

<p>As it chanced, it was at the precise moment when
Bromley was putting his companion into the buggy
preparatory to continuing the afternoon drive, that
Philip was descending from a hired hack before a door
that was seldom opened for callers in the daytime.
It was Madam Blanche herself, a woman who still
retained much of what had once been the beauty and
charm of a riant, joyous girlhood, who admitted him.
He stated his errand briefly.</p>

<p>“I have come for Mona—the girl you call ‘Little
Irish.’ Is she ready to go with me?”</p>

<p>“Ready? Why, she’s gone!”</p>

<p>“Gone?—gone where?”</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t tell me where she was going;
wouldn’t give me even a hint. But I guess she took
one of the morning trains. She left early enough to
catch any one of ’em. She said you’d given her the
money to go with.”</p>

<p>“No,” he denied soberly; “I gave her money so
that she could pay you whatever she might be owing
you, and get ready to marry me.”</p>

<p>The woman collapsed into the nearest chair.</p>

<p>“Marry you? Why, my dear man! What do you
think she’s made of? She’s too good a girl to do anything
like that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>“Too good?” he queried vaguely.</p>

<p>“Sure! She’d know too well what it would do to
you on the day you’d want to turn your back on the
sporting life. She cried when she went, but she
wouldn’t tell me what for: she said I’d know some
time to-day. And I do know now. She went to keep
you from doing the craziest thing a man of your kind
ever does. Some day maybe you’ll know what she’s
done for you, and what it cost the poor little soul
to do it.”</p>

<p>Philip found his hat and moved toward the door.</p>

<p>“I think I know it now,” he returned half absently;
and after he had paid and dismissed the hackman, he
went in search of the Jew second-hand man to stop
the dismantling of his rooms which had already begun,
tearing a small legal document, which he took from his
pocket, into tiny squares and scattering them in the
street as he hurried along.</p>

<p>Two days later, Reddick, who had dropped into the
Curtis Street chop house for a midday bite, found
himself seated opposite Bromley.</p>

<p>“Well,” he observed, “it proved to be a false alarm,
after all, didn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was, if you say so,” replied the play-boy
with his good-tempered grin; “only I don’t know
what you are talking about.”</p>

<p>“You don’t? Haven’t you seen Phil?”</p>

<p>“Not since day before yesterday when I bade him
good-by.”</p>

<p>“Gosh! Then it’s all new to you, is it? He is still
here—in his old diggings in the Alamo. It was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
flash in the pan—that marriage of his. The girl saved
his bacon by skipping out.”</p>

<p>“Um,” said Bromley curiously. “She must have
hated him good and hard to run away from half a
gold mine.”</p>

<p>“Hate nothing! It was exactly the other way
around. She thought too much of him to let him ruin
himself for life. Madam Blanche was in the office
yesterday, and she told me about it. A mighty fine
thing for the little outcast to do, it strikes me. This
is a queer old round world, and you can’t most always
sometimes tell what’s going to happen in it next.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” chanted the play-boy; and his appetite,
which had been capricious for a pair of days, began to
return with gratifying zest.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, which dragged interminably,
he changed his mind a dozen times as to the advisability
of telling Jean the newest news. On one hand, it
seemed to be a plain duty; but there was also something
to be said in rebuttal. Jean had already been
given the deepest wound she could suffer, and he hoped
it was beginning to heal—a little. Was it any part of
kindness to reopen it? True, she might learn any day
for herself that Philip had not left Denver; but every
day’s delay was something gained for the healing
process.</p>

<p>About the time when, still undetermined as to which
course to pursue, he was on his way to Madame Marchande’s
to walk home with Jean, he suddenly remembered
that he had a dinner engagement with the
Follansbees. Telling himself that this postponed the
decision for the time, at least, he hailed a passing hack,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
made a swift change to dinner clothes in his West
Denver room, and kept his engagement at the house
in Champa Street.</p>

<p>It was three hours later when he had himself driven
home from the rather dull dinner and its still duller
aftermath. Entering the cottage living-room, he found
Jean in hat and coat, as if she had just come in or was
just going out, and there was a napkin-covered basket
on the table beside her.</p>

<p>“I was hoping you would come before it got too
late,” she said. “Are you too tired to walk a few
blocks with me?”</p>

<p>“Never too tired when I can be of any use to you—you
know that,” he answered cheerfully. “Where to?”</p>

<p>“You remember the poor old lady who had the room
next to ours in the Whittle Building, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Old Mrs. Grantham?—sure!”</p>

<p>“I found a note from her when I came home this
evening. She is sick and she wants me to come and see
her. It is late, but I think I ought to go. She is all
alone, you know; no relatives or friends. That is the
pitiful thing about so many people here in Denver.”</p>

<p>“I know. Let’s toddle along. I have been to a
pretty stodgy dinner and the walk will do me good.
No you don’t—I’ll carry that basket of goodies, if you
please. What else am I good for, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>All the way down Eleventh Street to Larimer, and
over the Cherry Creek bridge to the cross street leading
to the dubious district centered by the Corinthian
varieties and gambling rooms, Bromley was trying once
more to decide whether or not to say the word which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
as he made sure, would reopen the grievous wound
in the sore heart of his companion.</p>

<p>But when at last he took her arm to help her up the
dark stair in the disreputable tenement opposite the
Corinthian, the word was still unspoken. And the
thing he was hoping for most devoutly was that they
might be permitted to do their charitable errand and
win back to better breathing air without running afoul
of the man who, as he had ample reason to know, was
now no stranger to the purlieus below Larimer Street.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> he had rued his bargain with the Jew second-hand
man—paying a stiff forfeit for the privilege—and
had reëstablished himself in his rooms in the
Alamo, Philip slipped back into the drifting current
which had been only momentarily arrested by the Mona
Connaghey episode, turning day into night and night
into day, gambling a little, drinking a little, assiduously
avoiding the few daylight friends he had made, and
adding nightly to a different and more numerous collection,
some of whom were grateful for the largesse
he scattered, while others regarded him only as a soft-hearted
fool to be played upon and cozened out of his
money as occasion might offer.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Middleton, the fat-faced
railroad clerk, appealed to him for help, and Philip
heard the appeal with the tolerant, half-amused smile
which aptly mirrored his changed point of view. A
younger brother of Middleton’s had recently joined the
rush to the golden West, and Middleton had secured
him a railroad clerkship in the freight station. So far,
so good; but almost immediately, it seemed, the boy
had been caught in the wide-spreading net of dissipation
and was in a fair way to be ruined.</p>

<p>“It is only gambling, for a beginning; but since he
is in the cashier’s office, handling company money, that
is bad enough,” Middleton said. “It won’t take him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
very long to find out that his salary won’t be a drop in
the bucket when it comes to going up against the skin
games.”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you take him in hand?” Philip
asked, the thin-lipped smile accentuating itself.</p>

<p>Middleton flushed uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“I was expecting you’d say that. But you know how
a kid bucks at taking anything from an older brother.
Besides, I can’t say that I’ve been setting him any too
good an example.”</p>

<p>“No; I guess you haven’t. But what makes you
think I might set him a better one?”</p>

<p>“I don’t. Just the same, he’d take a jacking-up from
you as coming from a—er—a sort of case-hardened
rounder, you know. That’s what you’ve got the name
of being, now, Philly—if you don’t mind my saying
so.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mind. If I come across your brother,
I’ll try to choke him off.”</p>

<p>This conditional promise was made in the afternoon
of the second day after he had agreed to the costly
compromise with the Jew furniture man; and late in
the evening of that day he caught a glimpse of young
Jack Middleton, hands buried in pockets and head
down, turning a corner and hurrying toward the
Corinthian. As Philip chanced to know, it was the
railroad pay-day, and it was a fair assumption that the
boy had his month’s salary in his pocket.</p>

<p>Entering the game room of the Corinthian a few
steps behind young Middleton, Philip waited only long
enough to see the boy plunge into play with all the crass
ignorance and recklessness of a beginner, before he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
intervened. Standing at the youth’s elbow while he
was staking and losing five-dollar gold pieces in swift
succession at one of the roulette wheels, he said, in a
tone audible only to the ear it was intended for:
“Whose money is that you’re losing, Jackie?”</p>

<p>The boy jumped as if he had been shot. Then he
saw who it was who had spoken to him and began
to beg:</p>

<p>“You—you mustn’t stop me, Mr. Trask! I’ve <i>got</i>
to win—I tell you, I’ve just <i>got</i> to!”</p>

<p>Philip drew him aside.</p>

<p>“Just how bad is it, Jack?” he asked. “I mean,
how much are you short in the office?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!—how did you know?” gasped the
boy.</p>

<p>“Never mind about that. How much is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s over a hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you know you haven’t a dog’s chance
of getting it back in a place like this?”</p>

<p>“But some of them win,” was the desperate plea.</p>

<p>“Yes, and a great many more of them lose. When
did you take the money from the office?”</p>

<p>“L-last week.”</p>

<p>“You called it borrowing, I suppose. But when you
got your pay to-day, why didn’t you put it back?”</p>

<p>“I don’t get enough; they’re only paying me seventy-five
a month. I lost the money here, and I <i>had</i> to
come and try to get it back. The travelling auditor will
be at the office in the morning to check us up, and
then——”</p>

<p>“I see. Jackie, there is nothing in this dizzy whirl
for you or for anybody; I know, because I’m in it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
myself. I’ll make a bargain with you. How much did
you say you are short?”</p>

<p>“I—I took six twenties.”</p>

<p>Philip drew a handful of yellow coins from his
pocket.</p>

<p>“This is the bargain, Jack. I’ll lend you the six
twenties if you will promise me to quit this business
for good and all. How about it? Is it a go?”</p>

<p>The boy’s gratitude was almost dog-like in its frantic
extravagance.</p>

<p>“Will I promise? My God, if you only knew how
I’ve suffered! I didn’t sleep a wink last night. And
I’ll never forget this, the longest day I live, Mr. Trask!
I didn’t mean to be a thief, but—”</p>

<p>Philip saw Sheeny Mike, one of the game room
spotter hawks, watching them narrowly.</p>

<p>“Chase your feet out of this, Jack, and remember
your promise,” he said; but the hawk had seen the
passing of the gold pieces and he started in pursuit of
the boy. Philip detained him with a hand on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Not this time, Mike; the kid is a friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“To hell with you! That don’t get the house anything!”</p>

<p>“Maybe not; just the same, it goes as it lies. You
ought to know me by this time. Keep your hands
where I can see them—it’s safer, because I can always
beat you to the draw. Now listen: if you had the brain
of a louse, Sheeny—which you haven’t—you’d know
that I am worth more to the house in a month than a
little one-horse railroad clerk would be in a year.”
And to show his good will, he turned to the nearest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
roulette wheel and took his place in the circle of
players.</p>

<p>It was something like an hour later, and after he had
consistently and painstakingly lost considerably more
than the sum he had given young Middleton, that he
drifted aimlessly out of the game room and across the
stair-head landing into the open space serving as the
back gallery of the varieties theater. A dancing girl
in chalk-white tights had just finished her turn, and
men in the crowded lower part of the theater were
pitching silver dollars onto the stage in lieu of bouquets,
stamping their applause with booted feet. Philip, looking
down upon the scene in a saddened reverie from
the gallery height, saw the beginning of a drunken fight
in the pit. Two shirt-sleeved men from the third row
of seats in the orchestra struggled up, went into a fierce
clinch and stumbled into the aisle in a pummelling
wrestle. Before any of the aproned bar-servers could
drop their trays and intervene, the wrestlers fell apart
and there was the sharp report of a pistol to dominate
the clamor of stamping feet—the crack of a pistol and
a woman’s scream.</p>

<p>The gurgling scream came from one of the gallery
boxes on the left, and Philip whipped out of his sober
reverie with a bound and ran. Half-way down the
passageway behind the row of cell-like boxes he collided
with a red-faced man racing to escape. “They’ve
shot the woman!” he gasped, struggling to free himself
from Philip’s detaining grasp. “Lemme get out
of here—I ain’t in it!”</p>

<p>Philip let the craven go and hurried on. In the box
of tragedy the curtain had been drawn and two women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
were kneeling over a third who was lying on the floor.
One of the women sprang to her feet as he entered and
her eyes were blazing.</p>

<p>“That pie-eyed —— —— —— down there shot at
nothin’ and got Lola!” she raged. “Don’t let her die
in this hell-hole! Get help to carry her over to her
room! It’s just across the street.”</p>

<p>In a trice Philip had captured two of the gallery
drink servers, and the victim of the wild shot was
quickly carried out and down the stairs and across to
the darkened building opposite, the two women following.
At the foot of the unlighted stairway where
Jean Dabney had more than once turned him back,
Philip found himself in the clutch of the woman with
the blazing eyes.</p>

<p>“Wait,” she panted. “There’s enough of ’em to
carry her up and to run for a doctor and her man.
What she’s needin’ is a priest, but she ain’t a Catholic,
and none o’ the others’d dirty their hands with the
likes of us.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” said Philip evenly. “I know
of one, at least, who will go where he is needed.”</p>

<p>“Then get him quick, for God’s sake! She’s dyin’;
the bullet went clean through and come out at her
back!”</p>

<p>“Go on and keep her alive if you can,” Philip urged.
“I’ll hurry.”</p>

<p>Luckily, he found an idle two-horse hack standing
in front of the American House, and he sprang in and
gave his order, bidding high for haste. After a reckless
race of a dozen blocks the hack halted in front of
a house yarded in the same enclosure with a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
brick church carrying a gilt cross on its gable; and
Philip was relieved to see that, late as it was, there
was still a light burning in the minister’s study. A
heavy-set, fair-haired young man with the face of a
wise and compassionate saint answered his ring.</p>

<p>“I have come again, Father Goodwin,” he began
hurriedly. “It’s a tragedy, this time. A woman has
just been accidentally shot in the Corinthian theater,
and I think she is dying. Can you come?”</p>

<p>“She is not a Catholic?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be with you in a moment.”</p>

<p>On the galloping race to the appointed destination
the young clergyman put an arm across Philip’s shoulders
in the darkness of the hack’s interior.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Philip: how long are you going to go on
throwing yourself away? The other time you came
to me from a woman dying in a brothel; and this time
you come from the Corinthian. Doesn’t your life mean
anything more to you than a wallowing in the mud?”</p>

<p>“It did, once,” was the low-toned response. “But
I have found out that it is one thing to knock the
barriers down, and another to try to build them up
again. As long as I hadn’t wallowed, it was easy
not to. But one night the props went out all at once,
and—well, I can’t seem to set them back again.”</p>

<p>“They were not the right kind of props, Philip;
you may be sure of that. Won’t you come and talk
to me like a man, some time?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Philip; and then the hack was pulled
up at the doorway of the darkened stairway.</p>

<p>Philip led the way up the stairs and around the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
gallery-like upper corridor to a lighted room with an
open door. The scene that revealed itself as he entered
and stood aside to make way for the clergyman
stunned him. The bed upon which the victim of the
drunken miner’s chance bullet lay had been drawn out
from the wall, and on one side of it a doctor, with
Jean Dabney standing by to help as she could, was
trying to determine the seriousness of the wound. On
the other side of the bed knelt a man with graying hair,
cold eyes and a hard-lined face which was now drawn
and pinched and haggard as he stared at the still
figure over which the doctor was working. Bromley
caught Philip’s arm and took him apart from the others.</p>

<p>“Jean knows, and I know,” he explained in a low
whisper. “We had come down to see the sick old
lady on the other side of the building. When they
told me who this woman was, I went after your father.
Don’t do anything to make it harder for him, Phil.”</p>

<p>For a long minute Philip stood looking down at the
face of the woman who had supplanted his mother.
It was the wreck of a face that had once been attractive,
perhaps even beautiful with a wild, gypsy allure.
While he looked, the dark eyelids fluttered and opened,
and the carmined lips framed a single word, “<i>John!</i>”</p>

<p>The doctor straightened up and drew Jean away,
shaking his head to signal that the end had come. The
clergyman knelt beside the dying woman and began
to speak in low tones. Bromley followed the doctor
and Jean into the corridor, and at the door he looked
back. He saw Philip hesitate, somber-eyed, but only
for an instant. Then the son went to kneel, with
bowed head, beside his father.</p>

</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I saw</span> what you saw as we were leaving the room—yes.
But what did Philip do afterward?” Jean asked,
looking up from her seat in the low wicker rocking-chair.</p>

<p>After taking Jean home on the night of the tragedy,
Bromley had gone back to the tenement building to
stand by as a loyal partner should, and for the three
succeeding days his room in the West Denver cottage
had remained unoccupied. Late the third evening he
had returned to find Jean sitting up, sewing, with the
two younger girls poring over their school books in
the rear half of the double sitting-room.</p>

<p>“Phil did his full duty,” was his answer to the low-voiced
question. “Took everything upon his own shoulders—funeral
arrangements, and all that; acted just
as if there had been no breach between his father and
himself—a thing he wouldn’t have done six months
ago, not if the heavens had fallen.”</p>

<p>“And you have been helping?”</p>

<p>“Naturally, I did what I could—which wasn’t much
beyond backing Phil up and running errands. He
seemed glad to have me to lean upon, so I stayed with
him. It was the least I could do.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Where is his father now?”</p>

<p>“Vanished into thin air, right after the funeral;
wouldn’t tell Phil where he was going; wouldn’t take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
any of Phil’s money; wouldn’t talk, except to say that
he wouldn’t get in Philip’s way again—not if he had to
take the other side of the world for his.”</p>

<p>“And Philip—where is he?”</p>

<p>“He left on to-night’s train for New Hampshire.
He is going back to square the—er—the matter with
the bank—so far as a return of the money can do it.”</p>

<p>“But he didn’t need to go in person to do that, did
he?”</p>

<p>“That is what I told him; but he seemed to think he
ought to go and face it out, man to man; that it was
part of the price he must pay for the sake of the name—since
his father wouldn’t pay any of it. I imagine,
too, that he wants to be there to bargain that his
mother and sisters are not to be harried by a revival
of talk about the old scandal.”</p>

<p>She nodded complete intelligence, saying, “I told
you you didn’t know the real Philip, Harry.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t; I admit it. He is as gentle and compassionate
now as he used to be opinionated and hard.
But he still believes he has put himself entirely beyond
the pale.”</p>

<p>She made a swift little gesture of appeal. “You
must try to make him understand that there isn’t any
pale—not in his sense of the word—after he comes
back.” Then: “He is coming back, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>Bromley nodded. “Yes; I think he is coming back.
But as to making him understand: I fancy there is
only one person in the world who can do that successfully,
Jean. That person is yourself.”</p>

<p>She bent lower over her sewing. “What makes you
say that, Harry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>He was not looking at her when he answered. His
gaze had wandered to the far end of the room; to a
girlish face framed in a tousled mass of yellow hair;
ripe lips pressed together and the fair brow wrinkled
as their owner puzzled over her lesson for the next
day.</p>

<p>“I say it, Jeanie, dear, because, in spite of everything
he has been and has done, Philip loves you, even as
you love him,” he said. “But he believes he has
sinned beyond your forgiveness. If you can forgive
him——”</p>

<p>She looked up to see why he had let the sentence
lapse, and when the distracting reason became apparent,
she laid her work aside and slipped away to the bed-room
she shared with Mysie. When she came back
she was holding one hand behind her. Suddenly the
play-boy found himself staring at a reflection of his
own face in a little hand-mirror. He glanced up at
her with the boyish smile that endeared him to all
women.</p>

<p>“You are a little wretch, Jean!” he laughed. “You
caught me red-handed, didn’t you?—just as you said
you would that day when we were out in the Highlands.
All right; it’s a fact, and I plead guilty. But
I’ll be good and patient and wait until you won’t have
to say that I’m robbing the cradle. Now that you
know what I was dreaming about, may I go and see
if I can’t give Mysie a bit of help? She seems to be
finding her trigonometry harder than usual to-night,
judging from the way she is making faces at it.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Bromley’s prediction that Philip would return to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
Colorado came true within a fortnight, and the news
of his arrival reached the play-boy through Reddick.
Going at once to the rooms in the Alamo Building,
Bromley found the returned traveller opening his mail.</p>

<p>“You made a quick trip, Phil,” was his greeting.
“How did you find things in the old home?”</p>

<p>Philip laid the envelope opener aside and felt for
his pipe.</p>

<p>“I found them pretty much as I expected to. And
there was nothing to stay for, after my errand was
done.”</p>

<p>“No trouble about the errand, was there?”</p>

<p>“No. The bank people didn’t ask any questions.
They were only too glad to see the color of their
money again.”</p>

<p>“And your mother and sisters?”</p>

<p>“They wanted me to stay, of course. They couldn’t
see any reason why I shouldn’t retire and settle down
at home as a solid citizen; why I should want to go
back to the outlandish West.”</p>

<p>“Well, why should you?” Bromley asked, with his
most disarming smile.</p>

<p>“You know the answer to that as well as I do,
Harry. In the old rut at home I had to be once more
a Pharisee among the people who had known me from
childhood, and one week of that was enough. Another
week of it would have stifled me.”</p>

<p>The play-boy’s smile broadened into a grin. “There
is plenty of breathing room out here, if that is what
you want.”</p>

<p>“Not room enough—in Denver.”</p>

<p>“No? Whereabouts, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>Philip picked up a badly spelled letter written in
pencil and glanced over it.</p>

<p>“This is from Jim Garth. He has found a prospect
up somewhere near the Mount of the Holy Cross, and
he asks me if I will grub-stake him for a winter’s work
on it. I shall leave this evening to put in the winter
with Jim. He says his claim is at altitude eleven thousand
and something. There ought to be breathing
space enough up there.”</p>

<p>“But why, Phil?”</p>

<p>“I think you know why. This gold-mad country,
or my own innate weakness or wickedness—call it
what you please—has made a sorry castaway of me,
Harry. As you know very well, I’ve travelled a long
and crooked trail since we came out of the mountains
together last spring. I don’t know whether or not
I can find my way out of the woods; it’s all rather
chaotic just now. I only know that I want to go bury
myself for a while and see if I can’t fight through to
daylight, somewhere and somehow.”</p>

<p>After a little pause, Bromley said: “You are thinking
only of yourself, Phil? What about Jean?”</p>

<p>“Jean? I thought I had given you time enough
there, Harry.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Jean loves me dearly—as a brother—as
she ought to. I’m going to marry Mysie when she is
old enough; that is, if she’ll have me.”</p>

<p>“Mysie? I never dreamed of that! But how about
the Follansbee affair?”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said the play-boy. “You don’t keep up
with the neighborhood gossip. Eugie begged off some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
time ago. She is going to marry Stephen Drew next
month.”</p>

<p>“Oh; so that little problem solves itself, does it?
But we were speaking of Jean. How much does she
know about my father—and me?”</p>

<p>“All there is to know. She has known it all along.”</p>

<p>“And she doesn’t despise me?”</p>

<p>“You’ll not get anything out of me; go and ask her
for yourself. Or are you going to drop out for a
whole winter without seeing her?”</p>

<p>It was the new Philip who turned his face away and
said, quite humbly: “I’m not fit to go to her now,
Harry; you know that. It would be a sacrilege—another
and worse indecency—to go to her with the smell
of the pit-fires still in my clothes. I love her too well
for that.”</p>

<p>“But you have never told her so.”</p>

<p>“No; and it is too late, now.”</p>

<p>The play-boy got out of his chair.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right, Phil; I won’t say you are
not. Is there anything I can do toward helping you
in the make-ready?”</p>

<p>“No; nothing that I think of. I’ll outfit in Leadville.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll be at the train to see you off.” And
as he shook hands at parting: “Don’t you know, Phil,
there are times when I almost envy you your confounded
old burn-yourself-at-the-stake Puritan conscience?
There are, for a fact; and this is one of
them. Good-by—till this evening.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVIII</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I don’t</span> believe I can climb any higher, Harry; the
air up here is so frightfully thin. You and Mysie go
on if you want to. I’ll sit down and wait for you. I
wouldn’t ask for any grander view than this is, right
here from this rock.”</p>

<p>Spring had come again for the altitudes, and though
the higher peaks of the Continental Divide were still
heavily blanketed with snow, the gulches were free and
the mountain streams were running bank full. Bromley,
with an ulterior motive that he was still carefully
concealing, had won Mrs. Dabney’s consent to take
Jean and Mysie on a flying trip to the summit of the
Great Divide, saying it was a shame that, after a residence
of two years in Denver, the girls had not yet
seen any more of the mountain grandeurs than could
be glimpsed from a car window on a Sunday excursion
up one of the canyons.</p>

<p>Making Leadville only a halting point, they had
come on up the railroad to a flag-station hamlet high in
the backbone range. By making a few judicious inquiries
in the hamlet, Bromley had learned what he
wanted to know, and which trail to take. In one of the
gulches far above the railroad, the gray, beard-like
dump of a mine or prospect tunnel could be seen, with
the help of the field-glasses, and it was on the steep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
trail toward this that he was leading his breathless
charges.</p>

<p>“Well wait until you get your breath,” he offered,
in answer to Jean’s protest. “There is no hurry. It
will be hours before we can get the return train.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he was sweeping the upper reaches of
the trail with the glass. On one of the nearer loopings
a man was descending. Bromley readjusted the focus
of the binocular and fixed the descending mountaineer
fairly in its field. What he saw made him stultify
himself immediately and shamelessly.</p>

<p>“If you really don’t care to go any farther, Jean,”
he said hastily, “Mysie and I will climb up to that
monument rock over there on the other spur. You
won’t mind? We’ll be in plain sight nearly all the
way.”</p>

<p>“Of course I won’t mind. I could sit here and enjoy
this magnificent view all day. Run along.”</p>

<p>Philip Trask, no longer crippled in body, mind or
vision, saw the three human dots on the trail below
him; saw two of them separate from the third and
move away to the left toward a hunched shoulder of
the mountain with a curiously shaped pinnacle rock at
its summit. “Tenderfoots,” he said to himself, “and
one of them is already out of breath.” He looked
again, squinting his eyes against the hard light of the
forenoon sun. “Humph!—skirts. I wonder who was
fool enough to drag a couple of women eleven thousand
feet up in the air? No wonder one of them has pegged
out.”</p>

<p>A turn in the trail hid the motionless figure at the
halting place for the time, though he could still see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
the others making their toilful way onward and upward
over the rock-strewn talus. As he drew nearer to the
one who had been left behind, the rock, upon one of
the lower shelf-like ledges of which she was sitting,
kept him from getting a fair sight of her, and it was
not until he was about to go on past her that he saw
who she was and stopped short.</p>

<p>“<i>Jean!</i>” he gasped.</p>

<p>She stood up and held out both hands to him, and
what she said appeared to take no account of anything
that had intervened, save the lapse of time.</p>

<p>“You, Philip? I wonder if I’m dreaming? Is it
really you—after all these months? Where did you
come from?”</p>

<p>“Out of a pretty mucky hole in the ground, as you’d
imagine,” he grinned, looking down at his earth-stained
corduroys and boots. “But tell me: how under the
canopy did you get here?”</p>

<p>“‘Canopy,’” she smiled; “that is New England,
isn’t it? We came on the train. Harry brought us—Mysie
and me—just for a little outing. We left
Leadville this morning. But I hadn’t the slightest idea
that we’d find you up here.”</p>

<p>“Just one of Harry’s little jokes, I suppose. I
think he meant it to be a surprise, all around. I wrote
him last week and told him where we were—Big Jim
Garth and I—and how we could be reached, now that
the snows have melted. I thought perhaps he might
care to run up and have a look at Jim’s prospect. It
isn’t a bonanza, but Jim can probably sell it for enough,
with the development work we’ve done, to take care
of him in his old age.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>“You have been working with him all winter?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We were snowed in most of the time, but
that didn’t matter. We had plenty to eat. But this
morning we found that the tobacco was all gone, and
at that, of course, everything had to stop dead until
one of us could go down to the railroad and get some.
No tobacco, no work.”</p>

<p>She sat down again on the rock ledge and made room
for him beside her.</p>

<p>“As I say, I hadn’t the remotest idea we were going
to find you up here. Harry never gave us the least
little hint—which was just like him. What a perfectly
glorious view there is from here!”</p>

<p>Her enthusiastic exclamation was well warranted.
The atmosphere was crystal clear, and across a
mountain-studded interval of nearly two hundred miles
of sheer distance earth and sky met on the remote
horizon formed by the serrated summits of a blue
range in eastern Utah. Philip pointed out and named
some of the eye-filling grandeurs: White Mountain,
Shingle Peak, the rampart buttressings of the White
River Plateau, and beyond these the Book or Roan
Mountains, too distant to show the striated colorings
of their majestic cliffs, and in the southwest, the far-away
bulwark of the Uncompahgres.</p>

<p>“I can never look at it without being made to feel
my own, and all human, littleness,” he said. “And,
after all, tremendous as it is, this is only a dot, a
vanishing point, in a universe too vast to be even faintly
comprehended by our little insect minds.”</p>

<p>She stole a glance aside at him. Lean, wind-tanned,
athletic, with work-hardened hands and knotted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
muscles, there was little to remind her of the neatly
groomed, reserved young railroad clerk who had sat
beside her in the Kansas Pacific day-coach two years
earlier; the “damn Yankee” she had told him she had
been taught to call him and his kind. Even his speech
was different now.</p>

<p>“This is a country of big things—this Colorado of
ours,” he went on, “and we little human insects have
to grow and expand to fit it—do that, or be blotted out
and lost in the shuffle. Doesn’t it make you feel that
way?”</p>

<p>She nodded. Though she was far from realizing it,
or had been, up to this moment, her two years of
burden-carrying in Denver had changed her quite as
much as his varied experiences and the breaking down
of the barriers had changed him. Then, with a smile:
“We were terrible tenderfoots two years ago, weren’t
we?”</p>

<p>“It was a country of tenderfoots then; it still is, in
a great measure. What a world of meaning there is
crammed into that one coined word! We call this a
new country; in reality, it is old—very old and wise
and shrewdly discriminating. It sifts the grain from
the chaff without mercy; and equally without mercy
the chaff is scattered to the four winds. We are the
new things; we who call ourselves the lords of creation!
Most of us were mere babes in the wood when we came
here—tenderfoots in all that the word implies. At
least, I am sure I was. You were different.”</p>

<p>“Not so very different,” she disagreed. “I remember
how sneery and unmannerly I was the day we met
on the train ... how I made fun of the ‘Philips,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
and told you you’d never go to the mountains. I don’t
believe you ever quite forgave me for that.”</p>

<p>“The Philip you knew then was quite capable of
holding it against you,” he admitted, with a reminiscent
smile. “In fact, if I remember right, I believe he
did cherish some boyish notion of showing you, some
time, how completely mistaken you were; how far
superior he was to your prejudiced opinion of him.”</p>

<p>She looked around at him with a flash of the old-time
mockery in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Does he feel that way now?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he returned quickly, “I think you know very
well how he feels now. Harry has told you everything
there was to tell, hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>She made the sign of assent, adding: “But only as a
loyal friend, you may be sure.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Harry is incapable of disloyalty.
What I am afraid of is that he was too loyal; that he
hasn’t stood the thing upon its rightful feet. It wasn’t
the finding of my father as—well, as I did find him,
that smashed me, Jean.”</p>

<p>“What was it, then?”</p>

<p>“Just my own miserable pride and Phariseeism—and
weakness. There was no excuse; none whatever. I
didn’t have to go to the devil merely because my father
had chosen to do so. On the other hand, it was up to
me to make the name honorable again, if I could.
But I didn’t stop to think of that.”</p>

<p>“How curiously things turn out,” she mused. “We
lived almost next door to your father in the Whittle
Block. I saw him nearly every day; he would be
coming in in the morning just about the time I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
be going to work. And we—that is, I—knew his—the
woman, a little. She was not all bad, Philip; she was
human and kind-hearted. When Mummie was
sick——”</p>

<p>“I know,” he interposed. “There is no shadow of
bitterness in me now, Jean; and I thank God there is
none of the old narrowness left—or I hope there isn’t.
It is a thousand pities that some of us have to go
through hell to find out that there is no such thing as
a hopelessly lost soul.”</p>

<p>“Have you found that out, at last?” she asked
softly.</p>

<p>“I think so; I hope so. And God knows, the price
I am paying for the knowledge is heavy enough.”</p>

<p>“What is the price, Philip?”</p>

<p>He hesitated for the fraction of a second. Then he
turned to her impulsively, hungrily, and held out his
arms.</p>

<p>“It is the knowledge that I can’t come to you with
clean hands and heart and soul, Jean. Isn’t that
enough?”</p>

<p>The dark eyes met his gray ones fairly and there
were quick-springing tears in them.</p>

<p>“Ah, Philip, dear ... it’s been such a long time!
And it might be enough to come between us—what
you have done; perhaps it would be, if—if I didn’t
love you so!”</p>

<p>On the pinnacle rock of the western shoulder of the
great mountain Bromley had been keeping his companion
interested in the wide-flung view; also, he had
been stealing a glance now and again through the
field-glasses, as he stood behind Mysie, at the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
figures sitting side by side on a ledge of rock over on
the distant trail. It was not until after he had seen
the two figures melt into one that he said:</p>

<p>“If you have looked your fill, Mysie, mine, perhaps
we’d better be getting back to Jeanie. Shouldn’t you
think she’d be missing us horribly by this time? Let
me climb down first; then I can catch you as you
jump.”</p>
